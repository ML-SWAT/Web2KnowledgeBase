Now that you know what my name is and

what I look like, hello. Feel
free to look around, and if you need more information about something
send me some email. 
If, like me, you have a passion for Golf, here's an
action photo.
Later,

What should you know about me?


































What should you know about in general?













Let's start with my advisor.... (better say this
to keep the money coming!).









With that out of the way, let's turn to the
original America's Team.









And of course, the league they play in.









For days other than Sunday, a round or two of Golf.









And finally: when you say Wis-consin, you've said it all!
