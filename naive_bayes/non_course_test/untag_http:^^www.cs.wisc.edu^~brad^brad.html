 Some links...



A link to the  UW Computer Sciences Home Page .
How about  the cs 640 Intro to Networking Home Page?
Or possibly the cs 736 Advanced Operating Systems Page?
It would be foolish to neglect the cs 737 Computer Systems Modeling Page!
You may be interested in thecs 132 Using Computers Home Page!
You'll probably be bored, but check out the  UW-CS Operating Systems Seminar
anyway.



 J'aime beaucoup boire le caf et le Dr. Pepper.
