Complementarity Problem Net: Algorithms and Applications




 Complementarity Problem NET

As a result of more than three decades of research, the subject of 
complementarity problems, with its diverse applications in engineering, 
economics, and sciences, has become a well-established and fruitful
discipline within mathematical programming.  Several monographs 
and surveys have documented the basic theory, algorithms, and applications 
of complementarity problems and their role in optimization theory.

This page serves as a center for information regarding research in
complementarity problems.  As such there is a listing of meetings
of interest to the community, some pointers to software for
complementarity problems as well as links to other pages of interest.
A listing of researchers and some application areas are also given.

Software for Complementarity Problems 



 

MCPLIB: 

A collection of nonlinear mixed complementarity problems, problem
description, and how to access the GAMS source files for
these problems.

 

Complementarity Toolbox for MATLAB: 

This (evolving) freely available toolbox consists of several mex and
m-files.  These allow all the MCPLIB problems to be accessed from
MATLAB without access to GAMS.  The mex files give function
evaluations and sparse Jacobian evaluations.  Machine specific
versions can be downloaded.
The PATH solver is also available in this toolbox, more details below.

 

Solver Interface to GAMS: 

This describes a library of routines that are
available to help hook your solver to the GAMS/MCP modeling language.
Contact steve@gams.com, rutherford@colorado.edu or ferris@cs.wisc.edu
for further details.

 

MILES: 

MILES is an extension of the classical
Josephy-Newton method for NCP in which the solution to each linearized
subproblem is computed via Lemke's almost-complementary pivot algorithm.
This Newton point is used to define
the Newton direction, which is then used in a damped
linesearch.  The merit function used measures both the violation in
feasibility and in complementarity.  MILES also employs a restart
procedure in cases where the Newton point cannot be computed due to
termination in a secondary ray. 
Every linearized subproblem is rescaled to equilibrate the elements
appearing in the data of the subproblem.

 

PATH:

(Runs under GAMS/MCP
or directly under MATLAB):
The PATH solver applies techniques similar
to those used in Newton methods for smooth systems to a
nonsmooth reformulation of the MCP.  The algorithm
consists of a sequence of major iterations, each consisting of an
approximation or linearization step similar to that of MILES, 
the construction of a path
to the Newton point (the solution to the approximation), and a
possible search of this path.  When the Newton point does not exists or the
path cannot be entirely constructed, a step along the partially
computed path is taken before the problem is relinearized.  A
nonmonotone watchdog strategy is employed in applying the path search;
this helps avoid convergence to local minima of the norm function for
the underlying nonsmooth equation and keeps the number of function
evaluations required as small as possible.  A list of solver options 
is given in the document 

 
NE/SQP: The NE/SQP algorithm is based upon
reformulating the NCP as a system of nonsmooth equations.
The NE/SQP algorithm implemented as a GAMS/MCP solver, its robustness
improved using a proximal perturbation strategy giving the 
QPCOMP algorithm.
The nonsmoothness of the equations is
handled using directional derivatives of H.

 

SMOOTH
 
The SMOOTH algorithm is based upon
reformulating the NCP as a system of nonsmooth equations and then
approximately solving a sequence of smooth approximations, which lead
to a zero of the nonsmooth system.  
At each iteration,
a smooth approximation to the original system is formed where the
accuracy of the approximation is determined by the residual of the
current point.  This is implemented as a GAMS/MCP system.

 

Other solvers 
have been implemented as subsystems of GAMS and are compared in this paper.
