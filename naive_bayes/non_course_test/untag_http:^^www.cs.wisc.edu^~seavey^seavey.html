 Beverly Seavey

 I'm currently registered as a grad student in computer science,
but will switch to a special degree in computational biology. 



 Non-computational interests of mine include:

 Asian classical dance 
 The different versions of Ramayana in India and Southeast Asia 
 The dance dramas Ramayana, Ramakien... of India and Southeast Asia 


 I wish you could finger me, but the Lab won't give me an account 
(hairballs and keyboards don't mix).  You can finger 
keeper instead.
