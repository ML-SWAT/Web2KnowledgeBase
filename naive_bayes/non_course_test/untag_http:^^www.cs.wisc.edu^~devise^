Features
These features distinguish DEVise from other visualization environments:

Visual query interface: Visualizations constructed with one
set of data may be saved and applied to other input data.
Data larger than memory are efficiently handled.
Mapping from data to graphics at record level. (e.g., you can
control the color or shape of individual records.)
Ability to query data records used to represent graphics.
Flexible layout mechanisms within windows. It helps user group data 
together for comparison, or put the aside when not needed.
Linked X, Y, or X and Y axes.
Cursor helps compare the relationship between different views
of the data.
Record based input data.
Direct input of ASCII files.
Integer, float, date, and string data types.

Related Work
The SEQ
project is complementary to DEVise in that it is designed to query
record based sequenced data.  The output of the queries may be
visualized with DEVise.

Release Information

We are currently releasing version 1.1.8 of DEVise. The executables
for the Solaris platforms are dynamically linked so you need to 
set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable appropriately to run
DEVise. On all other supported architectures, the executables are
statically linked and require no shareable libraries at run time.
