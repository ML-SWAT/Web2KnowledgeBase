Automated Theorem Proving Group



Automated Theorem Proving Group

The Automated Theorem Proving group is part of the Computer Science and Mathematics departments at The University of Texas at
Austin.

We produce methods and systems intended to prove theorems in first-
and higher-order logic with the intention of applying these systems
and methods to problems primarily in mathematics, but also in computer
science and technology.

Here
is an index of electronically-available tech-reports from our FTP site.

The ATP tech report series is not being continued currently.  New tech
reports are being added to the AI Lab tech report
series.
