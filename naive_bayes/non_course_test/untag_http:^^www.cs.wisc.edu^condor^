Objective:


The goal of the Condor project is to develop, implement, deploy, and evaluate
mechanisms and policies that support High Throughput Computing (HTC) on large collections 
of distributively owned computing resources. Guided by both the technological
and sociological challenges of such a computing environment, the 
Condor Team has been building software tools that enable scientists and 
engineers to increase their computing throughput.
