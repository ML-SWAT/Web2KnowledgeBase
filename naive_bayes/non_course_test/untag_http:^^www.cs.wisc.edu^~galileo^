Galileo at Wisconsin



Galileo is a project being conducted in the 
computer architecture group
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Our project focuses on the medium-
to long-term evolution of processor and system architectures, with an emphasis
on the memory system.  Specifically, we are studying what the
relationship between the processor and main memory will be in future
systems: completely separate, as today, or integrated (and if so, to what extent).

Processing capability and bit storage may merge in at least two ways.
Because of increasing off-chip penalties (in issuable instructions) and/or
limited off-chip bandwidth, designers may place more and more capacity
on the processor chip and module, until eventually a sizable fraction
of main memory resides on-chip (represented by the arrow labeled MOP
in the above diagram).  A different possibility is the migration of
processor capability onto the DRAM chips themselves, eventually
obviating the central processor (see the IRAM arrow above).

Our specific research currently focuses on the following areas:

Examining the performance impact of large memory latencies and
limited memory bandwidth in current and future microprocessor-based systems
Performance modeling of the various design points along the
processor/memory (P/M) integration spectrum
Cache hierarchy design for P/M integrated systems
Design of main memory banks in a P/M integrated system
Program execution in systems with multiple integrated chips
(DataScalar architectures)

SCI at Wisconsin
Our group is also closely involved with research relating to cache-coherent
shared-memory multiprocessor design, specifically studying the Scalable Coherent
Interface coherence and transport layers.
We are using SCI, which is an IEEE standard (1596-1992), as a base platform for 
the exploration of our ideas.
The SCI standard specifies a linked-list based hardware coherence protocol, 
which includes support for efficient synchronization primitives 
(Queue On Lock Bit, or QOLB), as
well as optimizations for different sharing patterns, such as 
pairwise-sharing and fresh read-sharing.  The standard also includes a definition
for an extremely high-bandwidth (1 GB/s), low latency transport layer in between
processing elements or individual clusters.

We are currently performing SCI-related research on the following topics:


Extending SCI with logarithmically-growing sharing structures
Efficient hardware synchronization for shared-memory multiprocessors
A scalability study of the base SCI protocol, including its standard extensions
Aggressive consistency models for shared-memory multiprocessors
