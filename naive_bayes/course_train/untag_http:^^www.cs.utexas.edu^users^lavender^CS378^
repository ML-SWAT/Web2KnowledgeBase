Description 
This course is intended for students that have already had an
introductory C++ programming course, such as that offered in CS 105 -
Introduction to C++.  

The objective of the course is to give the student an opportunity 
to think about solutions to computational problems in an 
 object-oriented  manner, capture  reusable
patterns of design  by constructing  polymorphic type
hierarchies  and write programs proficiently and professionally
using C++. The student will have to opportunity to program solutions 
to challenging problems using C++ and Java.

 Course Texts  
The following texts, available from the UT COOP Bookstore, are to be used during the course:

Cay S. Horstmann. Mastering Object-Oriented Design in C++, John Wiley & Sons,1994.
David Flanagan. Java in a Nutshell, O'Reilly  Associates, 1996.
