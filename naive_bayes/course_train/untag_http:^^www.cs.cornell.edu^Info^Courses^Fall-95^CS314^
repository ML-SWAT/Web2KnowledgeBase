HELP
If you have a problem related to a lecture, a homework set, or a
project, the best way to get help is to add an annotation at the
appropriate point in the course materials.  This will allow you to get
help not only from the course staff, but also from your class mates.
Otherwise, you should send email to cs314@cs.cornell.edu or talk to
one of the consultants.
