About file formats:  Most of the course 
materials above are provided in three formats:





  HTML:
    HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the document format handled by 
    WWW browsers, in fact you are currently looking viewing an HTML 
    document.  Many of the handouts we've provided were originally LaTeX 
    documents that have been converted to HTML using 
    LaTeX2HTML, 
    which is why they can be a bit strange.
  LaTeX:
    Plain ASCII text including formating commands.
    Simple things (e.g. assignments) are generally quite legible in
    this format.  For figures and complex math stuff, these are
    hard-to-impossible to read.
  PostScript:
    The 
    Ghostscript Home Page
    has free viewers (Mac, Windows, OS/2, Linux, ...)
