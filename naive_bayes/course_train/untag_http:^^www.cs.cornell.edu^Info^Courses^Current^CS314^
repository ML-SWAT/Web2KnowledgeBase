HELP
If you have a problem related to a lecture, a homework set, or a project, the 
best way to get help is to add an annotation at the appropriate point in the 
course materials. This will allow you to get help not only from the course staff, but 
also from your class mates. Otherwise, you should send email to 
cs314@cs.cornell.edu or talk to one of the consultants. 

Course Materials

All course materials are on a separate web server (which you may want to 
bookmark) and uses CoNote to allow annotation of the Web documents. 
The course materials include lecture notes, section notes, homeworks, and 
project files.
