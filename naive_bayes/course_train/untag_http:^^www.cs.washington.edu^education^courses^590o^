 CSE 590 O - Parallel Programming Environments

Larry Snyder
Autumn Quarter 1996
Mondays, 3:30-4:20 pm, Loew 220

  

Welcome to the CSE 590 O Home Page!



This quarter we will be reading selected papers from recent IPPS, PPoPP, ICS, Supercomputing, ICPP, and LCPC.  Below is
a tenative schedule for the quarter.  The atmosphere is casual and
will hopefully ignite some lively discussion.



Everyone attending the seminar will be expected to present one of the
papers.  There are still spots open, so hurry and sign up!



Please send mail to majordomo@cs with
"subscribe cse590o" in the body of the message to subscribe
to the class mailing list.
