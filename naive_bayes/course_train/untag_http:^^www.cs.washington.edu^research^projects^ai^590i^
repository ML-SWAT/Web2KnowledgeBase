  I've begun to update this file. Remember, if you want to add to it,
       check it out first using co -l index.html and check it back
       in with ci -u index.html. 
  This was added with Phoenix. So far, I'm not that
       impressed.

Way Older topics: 

  The official release of glimpse has been installed in /uns. Check
       out the manual
       pages, as well as the glimpse developer's home page. If you're
       interested in more details on how glimpse works, you can read the Winter 1994 USENIX paper on the design
       and implementation of glimpse. 
  Information on the Wide Area Information Server (WAIS). 
  zwhere, a
       Mosiac interface to the Zephyr Location Database. It shows the users
       currently registered with zephyr, makes a guess as to which room they
       are in, and shows when they registered with the zephyr server. (This is
       just another version of znol/zwatch/zlocate with some extra info and
       links, except that it shows the status of all registered zephyr users
       and not just the ones in a .anyone file.) 
  Notes on 590I
       lectures/discussions 
  Mail that has been sent to the 590i
       mailing list. 
  Displaying the belief that an index page should be short, Mike
       relegates the reviews of web sites (and
       comments on what makes a good web page) to another page. 
  ... and here are other miscellaneous comments 
    Rather than ramble, Kurt grumbles about some interface problems and improvements to mosaic that he's too shy to bring up in class. 
    Paul provides a luddite
	 perspective on the idea for an intelligent filter for network
	 information sources. 
    Nick provides some vaguely related comments. 
    The December 1992 CACM was all about information filtering. Check
	 out the summary article.
