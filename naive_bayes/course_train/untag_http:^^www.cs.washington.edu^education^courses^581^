Welcome to the 581 Home Page!

This is the World Wide Web ("the Web" for short) hypermedia document
for CSE 581 and contains information about the
class.  Keep in mind that this document is not static, and that new
information  will be added from time to time.

Prof. Ze-Nian Li of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C., Canada.

Tuesday, November 14: no class.

November 16 at 9:00. Dr. Bharath Modayur will be our guest speaker,
and the title of his presentation is, 
"Efficient parallel object recognition on SIMD and MIMD machines".

Tuesday, November 21.  Class will begin at 8:30 AM.
Topics: Completion of discussion of pyramid algorithms -- scale-invariant
operators, top-down algorithms, and segmentation through hierarchical
relaxation (using the ISODATA approach of Burt, Hong and Rosenfeld).

Finding term project topics

During the week of October 12-18 students should be actively
exploring one or more topics for the term project.
Written descriptions of topics should be handed in
on Tuesday, October 24.  A template for the writeups
is available 
here.

Resources
PVM (Parallel Virtual
Machine) is a software layear that permits a user program to run on a
virual machine made up of a heterogeneous collection of  one or more
workstations.  This is a convenient way to implement and study
distributed algorithms.


Intel SSD Technical
Publications include documentation for the Intel Paragon
parallel computer system.


The 
ZPL language  is a good language in which to implement
2-D array-oriented algorithms on the Intel Paragon.



Various
vendors of supercomputers and parallel machines.


Some info on
the MasPar, from the National Supercomputer Center in Sweden.

Some online information for the MasPar MP-2 is at the
University of Tennessee.
This resource was found by Neal Friedman.  He reports that
"they've also got some Paragon documents."


Here are some  errors in and corrections
to the course notes.



Copyright Notice:  The material in this course web is subject
to copyright.  While it may be viewed by the public,
it should not be installed at any web site other

Term projects are an important part of
the course.  These should be started during the week of October 16.

The review session for the final is schedule for Friday, December 1,
4:30-6:00 in 422 Sieg Hall.


The final exam is scheduled for Wednesday, December 13 from 10:30 to 12:20
in our normal class meeting room.  The exam is closed-book.

Term projects are due at or before 4:30 PM, Thursday, December 14.
