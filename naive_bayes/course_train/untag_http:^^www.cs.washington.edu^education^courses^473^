 Hardcopy Readings:
 Required text: 
The Elements of Artificial Intelligence Using Common Lisp, 2nd edition,
W. H. Freeman, 1995. (I've worked hard to create an AI textbook that is 
self-contained, so you don't have to purchase a separate book on Lisp,
you don't have to buy a separate book on AI example programs, and you
don't have to purchase a separate book on the mathematical theory.)



 Online reference materials for Lisp:
 What Lisp is.
 
The Lisp FAQ provides the answers to many questions about Lisp and
its implementations.
 
Common Lisp: The Language, 2nd edition is the standard reference
on Common Lisp. (It seems best if you access it via the table-of-contents
page, rather than by trying to download the entire HTML file or
postscript.)

 You can get the source code for 
the Lisp programs from The Elements of Artificial Intelligence Using
Common Lisp, 2nd edition.

 Here are some interesting links to info about how to use Lisp for
programming World-Wide Web applications.



 Facilities:
 In order to take advantage of the new Allegro Common Lisp for Windows
implementation of Lisp, with its excellent features for program
development and interface construction, we are using the
Intel Pentium PC laboratory in Sieg Hall.

 There is a free version of Allegro Common Lisp that is
for Windows 95 and Windows NT.  It can be
downloaded from franz.com on the Web.
If you have this kind of computer at home, with at least 8MB of RAM,
using this may be an attractive option for you.


 Final examination:
 The final exam for CSE 473 will be given
according to the UW schedule of final examinations.
It will be a closed-book, multiple-choice test.
Bring a mark-sense form with you to the test.  Here is a

list of topics that you should know for the final.



Announcements


 25 March.

 Welcome to this course and its course web!
This course is about artificial intelligence.  It covers
both the mathematical theory of AI and the implementation
of AI techniques in Lisp.  Topics include Lisp programming
techniques, knowledge representation, search, logical
reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, case-based reasoning,
planning, learning, language understanding, vision,
neural nets, and expert systems.




31 March.

 The reading on CLOS is now linked into the Assignment 2 web page.
 The course's newsgroup has been set up by the CSL staff.
"Newsgroup uw-cs.courses.cse473 has been created for CSE 473.
The newsgroup is accessable only through CSE machines.
Messages to the newsgroup can be posted by sending mail to post-cse473@cs
or by using a news interface such as Pnews or trn."


 22 April.

 
The mid-term examination will be given on Wednesday, May 1.


 22 April.

 There will be a review session for the midterm exam.
The review will be held Tuesday, April 30 at 4:30 PM in
our regular meeting room.


 26 April.

 
Note about Assignment 5:  We will be continuing the programming
part of Assignment 5 after the midterm.  For Monday, April 29,
turn in, on paper, the following:  All your solutions to Part 1
(exercises), your state representation in Part 2, a screen
shot of your user interface as it is so far, a description of
how you are or are going to generate moves in your search program,
and current status of the program.


 15 May.

 Workload Reduction Proposal (circulated via email) was approved.


 22 May.

Here is the schedule for the rest of the term:

 24 May (Friday) lecture on neural nets.  Preliminary demos of
project.  (Either give a preliminary demo right after class, or
turn in a 1-page progress report in class).

 27 May (Monday) Memorial Day holiday -- no class.

 28 May (Tuesday) Review session for Final Exam from 4:30-5:30 in
Sieg 231.

 29 May (Wednesday) lecture on expert systems.
Explanation of peer evaluation system for projects.

 31 May (Friday) Wrap-up.  Demonstrations of projects, peer evaluation
of projects.

 4 June (Tuesday) 2:30-4:20. Final Exam in Sieg 231.
Bring a mark-sense form with you to the test.
