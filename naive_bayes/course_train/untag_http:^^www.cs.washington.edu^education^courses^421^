About file formats:  Most of the
course materials above are provided in three formats:





  LaTeX:
    Plain ASCII text including formating commands.
    Simple things (e.g. assignments) are generally quite legible in
    this format.  For figures and complex math stuff, these are
    hard-to-impossible to read.
  Adobe Acrobat  :
    The latest  greatest.
    Get a free viewer from Adobe's 
    Acrobat and the Web Page.
    
  PostScript:
    The 
    Ghostscript Home Page
    has free viewers (Mac, Windows, OS/2, Linux, ...)
  
At this time, Acrobat is supported on fewer systems, but is
preferable if you can use it -- files are smaller, rendering is
faster and more legible, and it can print (which Mac Ghostscript
can't, for example).
