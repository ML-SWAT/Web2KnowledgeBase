Computer Science 418: 
 Computer Graphics 
Laboratory Exercises



This is the Web Site for the Cornell University
undergraduate computer graphics laboratory, CS 418. 
These pages contain all of the materials for CS 418 including
 lab procedures, software and student results.


CS 418 is the lab section for 
 
CS 417 
which deals with computer
graphics and scientific visualization at the level of Computer
Graphics: Principles and Practice by Foley et.al., or 3D
Computer Graphics by Watt.  CS 418 is currently taught by Bruce
Land, who is also the Project Leader for the Visualization Group at
the Cornell Theory Center.


These pages won first place in the  1996 ACM SIGUCCS  Web-based
Education and Training materials competition.
