Computer Science 417: Computer Graphics
 This page is evolving. 
It is incomplete but hopefully useful. 

This is the beginnings of a home page for
CS 417 which deals with computer graphics and scientific visualization at
the level of 
 Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice  by Foley et.al., 
or  3D Computer
Graphics  by Alan Watt.
 CS 417 is currently taught by Bruce
Land, who is also the Project Leader for the Visualization Group at
the Cornell Theory Center.

 Course Summary  
Computer graphics is a topic that requires mathematical, 
programming, and artistic skills, among others.
The content of the computer graphics fundamentals 
course at Cornell focuses on mathematical skills. The associated 
lab course, 
 
CS418,  is a programming course designed
to help illuminate the math. 

The course covers the following topics 
(but not all in the same year): 

 Construction of surfaces 
 
    Explicit  polygon  lists 
    Parametric operations 
    
       quadric surfaces
       figures of rotation
       swept surfaces
       tensor-product surfaces
       
 A parametric surface viewer 
    
     Implicit Surfaces
    
       quadric surfaces
       blobby models
       CSG operations
       surface tesselation
    
     Computing a surface 
     normal 
    Hierarchical
 grouping of simple objects to form complex surfaces. 
 
 Scene composition and animation
 
    Introduction to homogeneous coordinates
    Geometric transforms
    
       building objects
       kinematic animation

 Viewing of a group of objects 
 
    Camera transforms 
    Clipping to a view volume
    Projection onto a 2D screen
    
       parallel projection
       perspective projection

 Course Schedule

    Prelim #1 is on 2/27/96 at 7:30 pm.
The  first test 
from spring 1995 can serve as a general guide to my test style.
Also there is a list of all 
 scheduled prelims.
at Cornell.

    Spring break is 3/16/96 to 3/24/96.

    Prelim #2 is on 4/9/96 at 7:30 pm.
 This is a Religious Holiday for some students. NYS Education
Law §224-A mandates that faculty make available an opportunity to
make up any examination missed because of religious beliefs. In
order to facilitate preparation of makeup exams, students intending
to be absent in order to observe this holiday are requested
to notify the instructor by 2/2/96.

    Last Lecture is 5/3/96.

    Final is 
 scheduled  
for exam period 12, Tuesday May 14, 3-5:30 in Upson B17.
The final mean was 80 with a standard deviation of 15.
