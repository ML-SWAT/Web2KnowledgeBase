Graduate Student
Computer Science and Engineering 
Department
University of Washington



 Hi there! My name is Shuichi Koga (if you haven't noticed by
now). I've just started up graduate studies here at the University of
Washington. I haven't quite figured out what I'll be doing yet for my
quals (much less my dissertation!).

 I graduated from the University
of Virginia in May 1995 with a degree in Mathematics. I was also
heavily involved with the asian studies, foreign relations, and
government departments (I was originally slated to also get a degree
in asian studies). I also was heavily involved with the User Interface Group
and the computer science
department working on a project called Alice.

Since you're here anyways, why don't you take a look at...
