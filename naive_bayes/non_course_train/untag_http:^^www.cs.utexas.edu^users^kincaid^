Areas of Interest

Mathematical software, high performance computers, and  numerical analysis 


Summary of Research
My interest focuses on research using iterative algorithms to solve systems of linear 
algebraic equations 
with large sparse coefficient matrices.  Such systems arise in the solution of elliptic 
partial differential 
equations. The development and implementation of numerical algorithms and software on 
parallel 
computers is another area of interest.
