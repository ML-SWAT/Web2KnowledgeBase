	ABSTRACT


 Joshua Seims is a biologically-based neural network system, 
currently being tested at the
University of Washington's Department of Computer Science.  Having begun
in 1974 as a Lockean blank slate, Josh has learned to emulate observed
behavior and has successfully accomplished several tasks such as graduating
from college, traveling of his own volition, and has recently started to 
demonstrate the potential for independent creative thought.  The current task
we have presented Josh is to earn a Ph.D. in computer science, and we 
expect this to take several more years.  This document provides an overview
of Josh's cognitive and ambulatory achievements, organized into 
Personal and Academic
hierarchies.  Additionally, future work is discussed within each of the 
above contexts.
