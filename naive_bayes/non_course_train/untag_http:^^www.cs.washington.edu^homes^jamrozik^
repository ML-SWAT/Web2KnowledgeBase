 Research: 
My main interests are in Distributed Systems, Object-Oriented Languages and Software Engineering.

Currently, I am working on Global Memoy Management in a workstation cluster with

New high-speed networks greatly encourage the use of network memory as a cache for virtual memory and file pages, thereby reducing the need for disk access. Network nodes with memory-intensive applications can use the primary memory of lightly-loaded nodes as temporary backing store. This introduce a new level of the memory hierarchy: namely, a global memory cache that lies (logically) between local memory and disk.
Because pages are the fundamental transfer and access units in remote memory systems, page size is a key performance factor. Recently, page sizes of modern processors have been increasing in order to provide more TLB coverage and amortize disk access costs. Unfortunately, for high-speed networks, small transfers are needed to provide low latency. This trend in page size is thus at odds with the use of network memory on high-speed networks. We studied the use of subpages as a means of reducing transfer size and latency in a remote-memory environment.

I did my thesis research on Debugging in an Distributed Object-Oriented System in 1993 at the

Universite Joseph Fourier,
 Grenoble .
I was involved in the 

GUIDE
project at the 

Laboratoire Bull-IMAG
, part of the 

IMAG
institut.



Fun: 


There is a way to go to the ExTremE People  area. It's

Not here.
 

Visit the Louvre gallery 

 


Look at the maps of
 France , 
 Europe  
and 
 World  .


Some

family pictures.
 

Some

friends pictures.
