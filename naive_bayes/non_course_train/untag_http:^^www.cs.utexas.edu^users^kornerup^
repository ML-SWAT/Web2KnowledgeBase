Welcome to my home page ! 
 

I am a Ph.D. student in candidacy in the Department of Computer Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin.


Research

 My dissertation is on Powerlists, a functional notation for describing
synchronous parallel algorithms. In this work I study how the notation can
be mapped efficiently onto different parallel architectures, including
hypercubes and meshes. My advisor is Jayadev Misra, who invented the powerlist
notation and heads the PSP group here at
UT. For more information about my research see my  list of papers.  
Teaching
In the spring and fall semesters of 1995 I taught CS 105 C++ Programming in the Department of Computer Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin.

My Hotlist

Some frequently-used or interesting WWW nodes I've run across:



 PSP group:

    To make our work available the PSP group (Dr. Misra, Will Adams, Al
    Carruth, Markus Kaltenbach and me) has created a   home page. PSP
    stands for  Programs, Specifications and Proofs 

Formal Methods
    One of my professional goals is to promote the use of formal methods by
introducing them early on in the undergraduate curriculum. A good place to
learn more about this is the 
Formal Methods home page at Oxford. 

Some very good arguments for using formal methods can be made after reading the
ARIANE 5 Flight 501 Failure Report or
looking at my page of quotes that support
the use of formal methods.

The Computer Science Departments Home Page
Our department has a home page with
access to web pages for students, staff and faculty. It also has access to
The University's web server.

CS Tech Reports & Bibliographies:
 

For access to a collection of technical reports have a look at The New Zealand Digital
Library.

The
Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies is a comprehensive
collection of bibliographies in computer science. Hey, I even have entries
there :-)

Volleyball info:

Look at Volleyball WorldWide for
useful info about a great sport. You used to be able go over to Gregory
Gym, here on the UT campus, where you could find pictures of the mostly CS
Grad/Law/faculty/staff intermural champs of 91, 92 and 95, and runners-up
of 93 and 94  High Voltage Spikes and Last Minute.



A Great Day for the First Amendment


News flash (June 11 1996): The indecency provision in the newly passed Telecommunication
Bill has been ruled unconstitutional by a three member panel of federal
judges. For details see the EFF's blue ribbon campaign. 

On February 8, 1996 the Telecommunication Bill was signed into law,
making it criminal to transmit indecent material over the net. This means
that our freedom of speech was limited to what does not offend anyone
in Round Rock, TX or Salt Lake City, UT.

Please support the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and other
organizations in their fight against this law.  You can support this
effort by including the blue ribbon on your page. 

This page was created on April 19, 1994 and has been accessed  
  times since March 13 1996
