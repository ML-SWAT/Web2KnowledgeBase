 Ian's Place 





This is me, Ian MacDuff.



Below is an ultrasound image of 

Emma Elspeth MacDuff (name subject to change without notice), 
my unborn daughter.  She's 20 weeks from
conception here, with about 20 more weeks until she's ripe in
mid-December.  The view is a profile.  She's lying on her back looking
up.  Her head on the right, the upper-half of her torso on the
left.








When I'm not busy obsessing about my impending 

fatherhood, or my 

Master's Thesis
(which is part of the 

Chinook project), I pass my time by being as 

silly as possible.

I also remember to eat my

SPAM!  Do you?





Unfortunately, I also waste time with 

HTML and browse around for interesting stuff using

WebCrawler.

Here's pointers to some other neat stuff:

Frogs

TV Nation

Penn & Teller

Music Lyrics
