I am currently an Associate Professor in the Computer Science 
department at Cornell University. Before that, I spent
five years at AT Bell Laboratories.
This semester, I am teaching a course called Engineering Computer Networks.
I am teaching from a textbook I just completed, which will be published
by Addison-Wesley this December.


Most of my research is in
flow and congestion control,
mostly for connectionless networks (such as the Internet). 
The one line summary of my thinking is:
The one true religion is round-robin scheduling and packet-pair flow control.
Let me explain what that means.


Users can contend for a shared resource 
in one of two ways: first-come-first-served and round robin.
Unlike first-come-first-served, round robin scheduling automatically 
allocates fair shares of a resource to users and protects well-behaved users 
from hogs. If all queueing points in a network implement round-robin, 
then end-systems can determine their available fair share
service rate implicitly using the packet-pair 
technique.
They can then use the time series of rates to do stable and intelligent
flow control. Thus, round robin does implicit allocation of fair shares,
and packet_pair does implicit determination of the fair share for flow control.
In contrast, current proposals in the ATM Forum for flow control do neither
round robin (considered to be too expensive) nor implicit determination of
the rate (only possible with round robin). Maybe I was wrong the whole time ;-)


I have been working since 1991 in building ATM networks. One of them was 
Xunet,
a wide area ATM network that we built from scratch (routers, switches, all the 
software), which was operational from 1992 to 1996. The other is 
IDLInet in
collaboration with 
IIT Delhi, 
based on no-name PCs and equipment from Fore Systems
and Zeitnet.
IDLInet
source code is now in the public domain and is available from the 
Native-mode ATM home page.
The key feature in 
IDLInet 
is that the protocol stack is native-mode ATM, that is, an application
gets to write directly to an ATM virtual circuit. 
We also support an OS-independent signalling API that is SPANS compliant.


Finally, I have been goofing off building talking heads (facial animation)
and a snooping car (the car sends video in nv format on the MBONE, and can
be driven from a remote site over the Internet).

Papers

Here is a link
to my papers. Most papers are available as postscript.

REAL

I have been building the REAL packet-level simulator since 1989
and still maintain it. It has been installed at over 300 sites
(I have no idea how many people actually use it).
Here is a link to 
REAL version 4.0. 
You can also get the simulator from here.
The latest version is version 4.0, which I released in Fall '93.
Version 5 is in the works, includes a Tcl-based GUI, and should be
out by the end of '96 (if all goes well).

My Name

In the part of the world I come from (South India, Thanjavur District, to be
precise), people have only one name. They prefix it with their father's
only name (and, sometimes, the village name). 
There is no surname. Thus, my only name is Keshav, and my
father's name is Srinivasan. Unfortunately, when I fit this round peg into
the square hole of US custom, my first name is my last, which can be
confusing!


Quotable Quotes
"One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem,
and, if it were possible, speak a few reasonable words,"
Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe.
