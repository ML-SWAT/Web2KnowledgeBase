"It is almost a miracle that modern teaching methods have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; for what this delicate little plant needs more than anything, besides stimulation, is freedom." 

"I think life would really be empty if one is deprived of opportunities, if one always has to choose alternatives to his distaste, or if one is denied of actualization of his little wish or aspiration under a fearful duress of the "fate". I would think such a life is not much different from that of a car, a truck, or a washing machine."
