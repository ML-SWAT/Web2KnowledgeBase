first weeks of grad school


 
and a couple years later . . . . . 


 
  

I am a third year graduate student of Computer Science at the
University of Washington.  Currently, I do research in the area of
operating systems but I am also interasted in distributed systems,
languages, and compilers.  Besides grad school, my life is filled with
the Seattle drizzle, hiking and other outdoors activities (if I am not
busy enjoying the school or the drizzle), books and music.  

You can find a short description of my research  interests  and a 
resume  here.  There's also a list of my 
papers.  All of these are a bit outdated but that's what happens
when one has a busy schedule.

  

Projects
