 Database Environment for Vision Research 







 Overview  

The Database Environment for Vision Research was
designed as a general scientific database system, but motivated by and
intended for use in model-based computer vision. We provide a unified
data model, a highly graphical user interface, an advanced query
facility and an interactive laboratory notebook. The Database
Environment for Vision Research aids in scientific experimentation and
promotes data sharing in the computer vision community.  

In DEVR, entities are stored in hierarchical, relational data
structures.  The schema for each entity contains a name, a set of
properties, a set of parts, a set of attributed relations among the
parts and a set of graphic definitions which describe how to build
instance-specific visualizations.


 We are studying many different image database research topics including: 

 Visual Interfaces  
 Multi-Level Queries  
 Experiment Management
