But failing that, my fallback plan is to write a few games.


BattleBall(223k) is now accessible through this page!
The binary executable file is for the AIX 3.2 operating system, and unfortunately that's the only OS for which it's available (I want to port it to SunOS/Solaris, but I'm working and going to school...who has the time?)


BattleBall is a 3-D multiplayer game I wrote which runs
under X Windows.  It's about 7000 lines of C++ code that uses the C++
Standard Template Library and
A. T. Campbell's Binary Space Partition (BSP) tree library.
The image at the top of this page is a screenshot from BattleBall.


I'm a student here at the University of Texas at Austin in the (you guessed it) Computer Sciences department.  I'm interested in two research areas:
Geometric modeling/graphics

 the BSP tree - a really cool geometric model, and my main research interest
 CS 384G Computer Graphics

Software reuse/engineering

 Software Systems Generator Research Group
 CS 395T Automatic Programming
