Hello to all the curious browsers.  Welcome.  

I am a fourth year graduate student at the UW CS department. I enjoy
theory the most, but I also like to keep in touch with other areas
including AI and graphics.  More on my life and work: academics.  
  
 
 You may want to look at  Islamic
Architecture in Isfahan (a 1995 GNN Best of the Net nominee),
one of the cities in my home country of  Iran.


See ya!
