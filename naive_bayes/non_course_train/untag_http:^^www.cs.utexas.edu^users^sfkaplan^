Scott's Really Basic Home Page

Okay, long overdue, a slight update to my pages.  That doesn't mean that they're going to look at all fancy--expect very little.  But at least they'll be a little more current.

If you're interested here's some 
information about me.

Work stuff:

The University of Texas at Austin CS department.  I've finished one year, and I'm trying not to think of how many more I have to go.
The OOPS Group, the research group with which I'm working within UTCS.  Interesting systems and languages research (I think).
The class for which I am the TA, Object-Oriented Design in C++.  The instructor for that class is Glenn Downing.
Amherst College, a great place to spend your undergraduate days.  While there, most of my time was spent (not unpredictably) with the Amherst College CS department.
The Santa Fe Institute.  An amazing place where I spent one summer working.  A different kind of research, and not only CS-oriented.

Hobby stuff

It's not perfect, but Linux is invaluable to me.
Texas Squash home page
The Mead home page.  Like wine and/or beer? (Who doesn't?) Try this stuff.
Psion, Inc.  Makers of a very cool palmtop.  Without it, I would forget my own name.

People stuff:

Ted Anastasiou.  You wanted more people to check your page, Ted?  Well, I'm trying.
Dan Sharp.  An amazing home page, and a guy with too much free time.

Neat-o stuff:
Just a few miscellaneous items, in no particular order.

If you're in Austin, check out the Austin Dining Guide.  Actually this page has more than just that information about Austin, but I think that's the most important part.
Citizen Poke.  A good humor rag from Amherst, published in PDF.
Apple Computer.  They still do some things right, and my IIci lasted forever.  Alas, I'm no longer so sure that they have a very bright future.
Be.   A new type of machine, the BeBox, looks like it could be neat.


It's a simple page, but it'll do.  Better than nothing, and hey, you probably didn't have to wait for five minutes for it to load, right?  If you want to send me email, this page is maintained by me: sfkaplan@cs.utexas.edu.  But before you do that, you might want to grab my PGP key, which includes some links to information on PGP and encryption in general.
