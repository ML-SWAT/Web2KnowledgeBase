 The Emerald Project





Ideally, the development phase of a new FPGA architecture would make
use of a reliable set of mapping tools to produce accurate performance
evaluations of proposed designs.  Unfortunately, given the quick
production time frames faced by most developers, tool construction is
often postponed until after many architectural features have been
frozen.  To satisfy the need for fast tool prototyping, we have
designed Emerald, a powerful architecture-driven system for quick
development of FPGA tools.  At its heart Emerald provides the basic
features needed in all FPGA systems -- logic block analysis, synthesis
and technology mapping, global placement and partitioning, and
detailed placement and routing.  Its CAD environment provides an
efficient way to thoroughly specify an FPGA's routing and logic block
architectures, as well as architecture-specific metrics to tailor
placement and routing.  Moreover, Emerald's parameterized schematic
specifications allow architectural variations to be quickly captured
and evaluated.
