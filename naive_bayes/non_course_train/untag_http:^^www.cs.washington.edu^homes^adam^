Before I started drinking 8 cups of coffee a day, my hair was limp and
lacked body.





 


After six years of living the good life as a graduate student, I 
finally finished my doctorate in 
	
	computer graphics.
For the fall quarter I will do a post doc here at the UW.
Early in 1997 I will join the
Computer Science Department at
Princeton University.



From 1987 to 1990, I was a software engineer at 
	
	TIBCO
	(formerly Teknekron Software Systems)
in Palo Alto; I wrote software for people who trade stock.
Before that, I was an undergraduate student at 
	
	Swarthmore College
(class of 87) where I studied physics, occasionally.







 

A
 recent research project has to do with finding specific images in a
large database of images.  



 


Since then, we've been working on something called
 
"multiresolution video".





Here are a few photos.



 

I play ultimate frisbee on a team called
Umatata.



 

To get my address or phone number, look at my
".plan" file.





I ran across this photocopy of a fax of a photocopy of a fax of ... of the
hilarious menu from Seattle's least-visited coffee house,
Caffe Lardo.



 

A recent chilly night visit to Snoqualmie Pass made for an excellent view of 
Comet Hyakutake.
Here 
are some great pictures taken by my friend Marcus.








Here are some cool images that I made for fun:
