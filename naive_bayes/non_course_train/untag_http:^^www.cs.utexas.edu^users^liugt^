Welcome to my home page. I am currently constructing this page and 
will add more contents as time permits. For now I apologize for 
any incompleteness and resulting inconvenience.

Texas at Austin.  



 
Research


I am a member of Professor Mok's 

Real-Time System Research Group.  
My research interests include real-time
