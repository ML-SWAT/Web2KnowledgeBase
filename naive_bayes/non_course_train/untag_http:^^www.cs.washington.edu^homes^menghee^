About me

I'm a second-year student doing my MSc in 
University of Washington.
Before this, I was an undergrad at the 
University of Pennsylvania.
I've been a TA for CSE 471, CSE 142 and CSE 143.


Research Interests

I am interested in image retrieval, where the problem is trying to find
images in a huge database of images. 
Virage and
QBIC
are two commercial examples similar to the kind of stuff I'm working on.
Here are some 
snapshots 
of what I've done.


Singapore
Singapore InfoMap provides facts and
statistics about Singapore.
Try the Singapore
OnLine Guide if you plan to take a trip there.
The National Computer Board
is in charge of transforming Singapore into an
intelligent island. This is where I'll work when I graduate.
The 
Straits Times is Singapore's main English newspaper.
