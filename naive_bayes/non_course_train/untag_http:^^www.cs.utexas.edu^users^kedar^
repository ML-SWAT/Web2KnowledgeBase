About Me

Hi! Thanks for checking up on me.

I'm a doctoral student at  UT-Austin in the department of  Computer Sciences . 
My research advisor is Professor   E. Allen Emerson . I'm interested in the use of temporal logic to 
reason about concurrent programs, in the semantics of concurrency, distributed
algorithms, and automata
theory. 

I came here in Fall 90, after receiving my bachelor's degree in computer 
science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. There is a 
wonderful  IIT-Madras home page
 with lots of fun stuff. If you would like to know more about my interests, 
here's some  personal information .
