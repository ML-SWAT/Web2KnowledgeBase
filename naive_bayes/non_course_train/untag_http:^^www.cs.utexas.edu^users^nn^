UTCS Neural Nets Research Group









The UTCS Neural Nets research group is supervised by Prof. Risto
Miikkulainen. The group is part of the 
Artificial Intelligence Lab and the Computer Science Department, at the
 University of Texas at
Austin.  Our research concentrates on artificial intelligence and
cognitive science, including natural language processing, schema-based
vision, cortical self-organization, episodic memory, decision making,
and evolving neural networks with genetic algorithms.  Click on the map
