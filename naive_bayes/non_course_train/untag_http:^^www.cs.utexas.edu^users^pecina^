About Me

I obtained a PhD in Physics in May 1992
from the University of Texas at Austin. Previously I had completed a master in
Nuclear Engineering. Currently I am finishing a thesis to obtain the MSc in 
 Computer Sciences Department at The 
University of Texas at Austin.  During my graduate studies in physics I worked
investigating a gauge theory of gravity based on the group ISL(4,R). The aim 
was to quantize the gravitational field. I calculated the invariants for this 
group and their unitary irreducible representations. This was published in 
three joint papers with one of my dissertation advisors, Yuval Ne'eman (my 
other dissertation advisor was George Sudarshan) and with Jurgen Lemke from
Cologne, Germany. My previous position was in the Bureau of Economic Geology. 
I spent a year in a half working in seismic inversion tomography. My 
supervisor was Bob Hardage (Editor of GEOPHYSICS Journal of the Society of 
Exploration Geophysicists). My research interests in computer science is in 
algorithms, numerical analysis, parallel computation, cryptography, and the 
quantum computer. I have also been a research visitor in the Theory Group of The
Physics Department in Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. Currently 
I have opened a company in scientific software development. I am interested in 
fill the gap between scientific and comercial software. My current interest in 
physics is in CPT symmetry, Lie algebras, Lie groups and its representations and 
invariants. I am also exploring numerical (sequential and parallel) solutions
in General Relativity problems and also in Quantum Chromodynamics
