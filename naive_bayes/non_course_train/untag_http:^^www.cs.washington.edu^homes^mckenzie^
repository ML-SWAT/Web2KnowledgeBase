Current projects



Gonna get my PhD, I'm a teenage lobotomy.  -- The Ramones



I am living on the East Coast, about 3000 miles east of Seattle, and
working for MERL as noted above.  I am currently involved with a project
concerning real-time volume rendering of medical data.


In my copious free time as an expatriate graduate student,
I am working on
chaotic routing
with faculty advisors
 Carl Ebeling and
 Larry Snyder.
Chaotic routing is a packet routing algorithm for mesh and torus
networks.  My dissertation is on the design and implementation of the
Cranium message-passing interface that is compatible
with a network using chaotic routing.
  


Past projects

I was a teaching assistant for 

CSE 142 in Summer 1994.


I designed and implemented a chip tester called the
 MacTester.


I was the maintainer for Carl's netlist graph isomorphism tool called

Gemini.  In industry-speak it is known
as an LVS (Layout Vs. Schematic) tool.  Gemini is available by FTP;
if you are interested, please send e-mail to Larry McMurchie

(larry@cs.washington.edu).

 


Publications



 Cranium: an Interface for Message Passing on Adaptive Packet
Routing Networks.
Proceedings of Parallel Computer Routing and
Communication Workshop, Seattle WA, May 1994.

 Personal information

 
Angel and I married in 1991.


Here is a
 picture of our house in Arlington, Massachusetts.


Before heading to the East Coast, we used to live
in the fashionable Seattle neighborhood of
Ballard.


Here is Angel's Creative Page,
which contains some examples of her computer artwork
created using Adobe Photoshop.


I owned
this car for 11 years.  Now only
the memories remain. 

I won a
T-shirt by correctly
guessing the answer to
Riddle du Jour on October 7, 1995.


This is the label that is placed on jars of
 McKenzie Country Farm Honey produced by my
uncle Bob McKenzie in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
