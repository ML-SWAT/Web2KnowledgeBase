Qualitative reasoning uses incomplete knowledge to compute a description
of the possible behaviors for dynamic systems. For complex systems containing
a large number of variables and constraints, the simulation frequently
is intractable or results in a large, incomprehensible behavioral description.
Abstraction and aggregation techniques are required during the simulation
to eliminate irrelevant details and focus the simulation on the distinctions
of interest. I am developing abstraction and aggregation techniques which
address some of these problems. In particular, I am interested in abstraction
techniques which can be automatically applied during a simulation. This
will facilitate the integration of qualitative simulation techniques with
large scale knowledge bases and automatic model building. The following
techniques have been developed to address these issues:
