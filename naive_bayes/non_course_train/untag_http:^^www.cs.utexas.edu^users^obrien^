Hi, I'm Meghan.  Welcome to my home page. (Please wipe your feet before
 entering.)



Due to many complaints about my "crappy", "laughing stock of the Internet"  Web Page, I have removed all the links until I get a chance to work on it.  Thanks to all who sent in your insults.  


 Don't Panic 

Don't panic, you can still download that gorgeous picture of me and blow it up to poster size.  

  Beauty Queen      



 We have a date !!! 

For those of you waiting to hear, Paul and I are getting married on August 17.  Hope you can come (except for those of you who insulted my Web page). 





If anyone wants to give me a job, feel free to do so.  Here's my  resume.
