Research Interests
I've been doing research on operating system support
for 

high performance memory systems
with really smart people like

Brian Bershad,

Brad Chen,
Alan Eustace,

Anna Karlin, 

Dennis Lee, 

Wayne Ohlrich, and

Wayne Wong.


Three recent papers on this subject:



Reducing TLB and Memory Overhead Using Online
Superpage Promotion.
Romer, Ohlrich, Karlin and Bershad.  ISCA '95, pp. 176-187.

Dynamic Page Mapping Policies for Cache Conflict Resolution
on Standard Hardware.
Romer, Lee, Bershad, and Chen.  OSDI '94, pp. 255-266.

Avoiding Conflict Misses Dynamically in Large Direct-Mapped
Caches.
Bershad, Lee, Romer, and Chen.  ASPLOS VI, pp. 158-170.



In addition, some friends and I have been studying the performance of
interpreters.  You can learn more from the
Project Rocky
home page.  We also wrote a paper together:



The Structure and Performance of Interpreters .
Romer, Lee, Voelker, Wolman, Wong, Baer, Bershad, and Levy.
ASPLOS VII, to appear.

My friend Dylan
said his hair couldn't be cut with a Flowbee.  We said it could.  Being
experimental scientists, we conducted an experiment.  You can judge the 
results yourself.


After attending ISCA '95, I travelled in Europe and took some
pictures.
