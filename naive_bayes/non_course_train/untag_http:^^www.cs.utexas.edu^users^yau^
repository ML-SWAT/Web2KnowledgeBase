Getting into business 


What I do for research? 





Outside of work, but let's still try to be serious 


Some of my favorite quotes.

Classical guitar: 
A concert by
the Assad brothers
in the Hong Kong Arts Festival (must have been '81 or '82)
first introduced me to the beauty of the classical guitar.
Christopher Parkening
is a guitarist with an interesting life story to tell: he once grew tired of
concertizing, retiring at age 30; then reconciliation with God through 
Jesus Christ rekindled his passion for his art. There is also the
Amsterdam Guitar Trio. 
The French are rich in artistic flair, like their national football team led by Michel Platini, and the 

Label France Magazine
published by le Minist des Affaires  



Amy Chow, the US woman gymnast.
