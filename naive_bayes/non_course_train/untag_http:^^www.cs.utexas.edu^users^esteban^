Pardon the Dust! 



So, Who Am I?

I am currently a student working towards a Master of Arts degree in the 
Computer Science department 
of the University of Texas.  
My thesis describes a new system for performing syntactic 
extensions in the Scheme programming language.


I wasn't always a student.  I once had a life...see my
resume if you don't believe me.


A few items of personal interest:


My Plan
My Resume     
My Research Interests
A psuedo-random collection of WWW links
The Carl Household     


My Daily Dose of Things on the World Wide Web


     Snow on Pike's Peak?  See for Yourself!

     Houston Chronicle Interactive: Sports

     For What It's Worth: Rice Athletics

     The Rice University Marching Owl Band
