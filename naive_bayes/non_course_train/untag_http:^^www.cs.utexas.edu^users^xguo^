Welcome to my home page!

 About me 
I've been hanging around at 
the University of Texas at Austin for a while. Being a Ph.D student in 
 Department of Computer Science ,
I work in 
Distributed Multimedia Computing Lab headed by 
Dr. Harrick Vin. 
This year, the graduate program of UT-CS is 
ranked 7th in the nation,
what a delightful surprise. No, not really a surprise, we've been doing pretty 
well,
do we? 


A picture of me? Well,
it's hard to take a picture of myself. I'm working on it, my picture as
well as more interesting stuff will be on line soon. Right now, as a temporary
resort, you can imagine of me as ... , Hopefully, as time goes by, I'll
gradually walk out of that paper and present a clearer image. 

I create a link if I find it interesting, I create a page when I feel I have
something to say. I'm watching you.
