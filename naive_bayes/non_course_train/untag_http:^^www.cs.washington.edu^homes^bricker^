Research Info

 My research interest is primarly graphical user
interfaces, although I am a self-proclaimed graphics groupie.  I'm
I'm currently working with Steve
Tanimoto on the Mathematics
Experiences Through Image Processing (METIP) project.  The goal of
this project is interest junior high school kids in mathematics using
exploratory rather than rote learning methods.  In particular, I'm
interested in developing Computer Supported
Collaborative Learning (CSCL) user interfaces that can be used in
this, as well as other, projects.
