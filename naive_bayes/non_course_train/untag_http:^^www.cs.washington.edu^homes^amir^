Graduate Student




I am a second year graduate student in the department of Computer Science
at the University of Washington. My research interests include the following
areas: algorithm design, software engineering, and educational software.


I have a Master's Degree from the University
of Toronto. My master's thesis is on optimal broadcast and summation
for hierarchical ring architectures. Shift-click here

Recently, I have been experimenting with new ways to teach algorithms.
In particular, I have built Opsis, a Java applet
designed to teach balanced binary tree algorithms in a way that combines
programming, proof, and animation. 

Finally, here is a 3D Lunar Lander style game
that I wrote for the SGI as part of an undergraduate graphics course. 

Some quotations from computer scientists: 


Mathematicians tend to be conservative, and many are unwilling
to consider that there might be a better way of writing proofs. But, I
am told that mathematicians are embarrassed to learn that they published
incorrect theorems, so they are motivated to avoid errors. I believe they
will like structured proofs if they can be persuaded to try them. 

Computer scientists are more willing to explore unconventional proof
styles. Unfortunately, I have found that few of them care whether they
have published incorrect results. They often seem glad that an error was
not caught by the referees, since that would have meant one fewer publication.
I fear that few computer scientists will be motivated to use a proof style
that is likely to reveal their mistakes. -- Leslie Lamport 

There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way
is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
-- C. A. R. Hoare
