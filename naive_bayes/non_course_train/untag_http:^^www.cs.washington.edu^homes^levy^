Hank Levy's Home Page








 Henry M. Levy, Professor, 
joined the faculty in 1983.  Hank's current research 
projects focus on operating systems,
on parallel and 
distributed computing, on computer architecture (particularly
"Simultaneous Multithreading" architectures)
and on object-based languages and environments.  A recent project
called Opal 
deals with single-address space operating systems for
64-bit computer architectures.  The
Etch project
is producing a tool for performance instrumentation and optimization of
x86 binary executables.

Levy is author of two books 
and numerous papers on computer systems, including
``outstanding paper''selections from four consecutive
ACM Symposia on Operating Systems Principles.  He 
is former chair of ACM SIGOPS
(the Special Interest Group on
Operating Systems), and program chair for the
16th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, to
be held in 1997.  He holds a B.S. from Carnegie-Mellon University
and an M.S. from the University of Washington.
Before coming to Washington, he was a Consulting Engineer with 
Digital Equipment Corporation, where his work spanned the range 
from operating systems to architectures for distributed systems 
and workstations.  Hank is a Fellow of the 
Association for Computing Machinery
and recipient of a 
Fulbright Research Scholar Award.

Eleven Master's students and nine Ph.D. students have survived
Levy's supervision;  the Ph.D. students have
all escaped to academic positions or major research labs.
When not glued to his workstation, Hank can usually be
found skiing, biking, playing tennis, helping to lead the
department's infamous softball team (the 
Smiling 
Potatoes of Death), or sampling desserts at one of 
Seattle's many dessert parlors.
