Vladimir Lifschitz

When feeling burdened or downcast,... the human mind will gladly turn to the
realms of Mathematics, where a lucid and precise grasp of objectivities is
obtained and insight is gained so pleasantly through appropriate concept
formation.  Here the human spirit feels at home. -- Paul Bernays, 1955
