Cliff got his B.A. in Computer Studies from Northwestern University in 1990, but got
himself employed as a programmer anyway.  He spent two years writing an
email client and a portable visual object library for Odesta Systems Corporation.
He left there for the Institute for the
Learning Sciences in 1992, where he
wrote educational and traning software in Macintosh Common Lisp, and then
implemented a simulated environment for educating high school students
called the GAMES
Project.

Cliff is now a graduate student in the Computer Sciences Ph.D. program at UT Austin.  He hangs out in the Robotics Lab
annoying people with his hair-brained schemes about meaning,
non-symbolic representation, and artificial life.

When not programming, Cliff sleeps.  In his dreams, he reads and writes 
fiction; listens to Ali Farka Toure and Medeski, Martin and Wood; watches 
MST3K reruns; plays on his Korg DS-8; and rides his bike all over.  Turnons 
include: breakfast in bed, new system versions, and raspy-voiced 
Starfleet captains.  Turnoffs: republicans, Microsoft, hangovers.
