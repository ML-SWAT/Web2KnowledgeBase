 Examining the interaction between balanced scheduling and other compiler optimizations

 Jack L. Lo
Ph.D. Qualifying Examination Written Report, May 6, 1994




I'm currently working on architectural and compiler support for
 
Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT).
My research interests also include static and dynamic scheduling for 
superscalar and VLIW processors, instruction-level parallelism issues,
as well as compilation for multithreaded architectures.  In particular,
I am investigating compilation issues for 
Jack's Lo-down on WWW pages
