Germany  in Spring of 1973. In 1989, he completed his Mittlere Reife (10th
grade) at the Schillergymnasium in Cologne before coming to the United States

he is working towards a PhD at the 
University of Washington  with an expected completion date sometime this
century.

Print Yourself

Something crazy I did. I didn't even come up with this particular
solution myself, but the implementation was done by me. It's
all on one line and shouldn't contain a trailing carriage return
(384 bytes). Compiles without warning with gcc. If you run it,
this program will print it's exact source code. If you can do it
in fewer bytes in C, I'd like to see it!


v(c){putchar(c);}u(char*x){for(;*x;x++)if(*x-92)if(*x-34
)v(*x);else{v(92);v(34);}else{v(92);v(92);}v(92);v(48);}
char x[]={37,115,0};main(){char*b="v(c){putchar(c);}u(ch
ar*x){for(;*x;x++)if(*x-92)if(*x-34)v(*x);else{v(92);v(3
4);}else{v(92);v(92);}v(92);v(48);}char x[]={37,115,0};m
ain(){char*b=\"\0\";printf(x,b);u(b);u(b+=148);printf(x,
b);}\0";printf(x,b);u(b);u(b+=148);printf(x,b);}
