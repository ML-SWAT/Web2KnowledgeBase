Current Research

   The 
Internet Softbot  enables a human user to state  what  he
or she wants accomplished. The Softbot disambiguates the request and
dynamically determines  how  and  where  to satisfy it.

The Softbot was one of the  5
finalists  in the 1995  Discover
Awards for Technological Innovation in Computer Software.








 The 
MetaCrawler Softbot is a fielded Web service that enables you to search
multiple Web Indices in parallel, and provides sophisticated pruning
options.  Try it!


c|net
recommends the MetaCrawler as the search service of choice!





 The 
Ahoy Softbot is a White Page service for the Web that locates
individual's home pages with high accuracy.   Try it!



  Brute
force learning:  Brute can analyze 100,000 hypotheses a second, when
run on a SPARC-10.
