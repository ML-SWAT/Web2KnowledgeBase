About me

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science
and Engineering at the University of Washington.  What do
you need to know about me?  I like music and books.  I
love to play games, ride my bike, write letters, and drink tea.  My
favorite color is blue, my favorite ocean is the Atlantic, and my old
roommate thinks I'm more like an owl than any other animal.

Northern Ireland

I returned from my trip to Belfast on June 8th, carrying sixty pages
of notes from interviews in my carry-on luggage.  Now, I need to get
those semi-chaotic notes into a readable and hopefully enlightening
format.  As I work on this draft, feel free to read over my shoulder;
I will periodically make my drafts available here in both html and PostScript formats.
The goal is to encourage frequent feedback as soon as possible.
Please read and then mail me.

Please note as well that I have not had much time to work on this
project lately.  Hopefully, we'll see some progress near the end of
the summer.

Go

I'm new to the game of Go, but I'm already addicted.  If you're
curious about the game, check out these links:


   For a fascinating, thorough history of the development of the
       game in China, read
       Go
       in Ancient China.
   The Go page at imageek.york.cuny.edu.
   Ken's
       Go page provides many links to interesting Go sites.
   Jansteen's
       page is the most thorough I've seen.
