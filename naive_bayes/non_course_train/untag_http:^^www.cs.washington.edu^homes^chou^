Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I am a grad student in computer
science at the U of Washington.
We are in Seattle.  The picture on the right is me on the first day of 
school in the Fall quarter, 1996.  Ross thinks it's scary.

Personal info about me.

Resume


Food

I enjoy cooking. Some people say I should open a restaurant. Some of
people's favorite dishes include stir-fried rice noodles and my BBQ beef
skewers. My recipes are now on-line. 

Toys

Being a computer geek, I have computers
and cool toys. 

Taiwanese

I am also promoting the use of the Taiwanese
language. I am currently developing computer tools for Taiwanese. Be sure
to check out my new experimental on-line Taiwanese
dictionary. Though not absolutely required, these pages are best viewed
if you install Chinese character fonts. 
If you are using a Java-enabled browser like Netscape, you should be
able to see my Java-oke (TM) applet, with a yellow ball 
bouncing
over Barney the purple dynosaur.
