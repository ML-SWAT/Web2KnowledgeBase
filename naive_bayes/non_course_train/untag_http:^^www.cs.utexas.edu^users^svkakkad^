Research Information

I am a member of the  OOPS Research Group in
the  Department of Computer Sciences at 
The University of Texas at Austin.


As part of my Ph.D. research, I have implemented a persistent storage
system, called Texas, for C++. It provides easy persistence,
while using a novel technique called "pointer swizzling at page fault
time" to efficiently support large addresses on standard hardware.

For more information, please see the list of my
publications (along with brief descriptions). 

I plan to graduate with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in May 1996. My
resume is available in Postscript. 

I am currently working at Motorola at Somerset Design Center, while
finishing up my Ph.D. in Computer Science.
