I'm pursuing a 
PhD
in Computer Science here 
at the University of Washington,
Seattle.  The beautiful campus of the University lies in the heart of
Seattle, 
offering many diversions which graduate students often fall prey, thereby
extending the time of the average graduate student career.

Research Experience and Interests

My research centers around parallel and distributed computing.  The challenges
presented by the fields are ones of performance, portability and convenience.
Performance is typically the foremost goal in running in a parallel or
distributed environment, however, portability suffers.  Finally, these
environments offer extra challenges due to asynchronous, independent events.
It is a daunting task to develop systems for parallel and distributed
environments.  These are the issues I address.
