 Ashish Thusoo

 I'm a graduate student in the 
Department of Computer Science at the 
University of Wisconsin, Madison. I come from
 India, and had
my undergraduate education at the  Indian
Institute of Technology, Delhi. The 
Department of CS at IITD is a fantastic place and worth visiting.

 If you'd like to contact me, you can
finger me to find my whereabouts.
Alternatively, you can send email to me at  ashisht@cs.wisc.edu .
