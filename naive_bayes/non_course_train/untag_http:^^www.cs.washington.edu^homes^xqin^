I am a 5th year graduate student working with  

Jean-Loup Baer. 
My research interests include computer architectures,
parallel and distributed systems, 
performance evaluation methods such as modeling and simulation.  
My short term goal is to get out of school as soon as possible. 

 Papers: 

A Performance Evaluation of Cluster-based Architectures, 
Qin and Baer, submitted to a conference.



On the Use and Performance of Explicit Communication
Primitives in Cache-coherent Multiprocessor Systems, 
Qin and Baer, To appear in the Proceedings of HPCA-3.
