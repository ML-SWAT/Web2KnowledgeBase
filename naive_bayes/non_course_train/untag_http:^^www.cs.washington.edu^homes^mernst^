Michael Ernst

I am a graduate student in the University of Washington computer science department.
Previously, I have been a lecturer in the Rice
University computer science
department, a researcher in the Program
Analysis Group at Microsoft Research,
and a graduate student at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science in the MIT EECS Department.
These WWW pages are not frequently updated.

My technical interests include:

   compilation: static analysis, slicing,
    debugging optimized code, serialization of parallel programs; I was program
    chair for IR '95, the intermediate representation
    workshop colocated with POPL
    '95
   intellectual property, particularly in computer
    programs
   other areas including game theory,
    cryptography, philosophy, and denotational semantics


I maintain a list of resources
for conference and workshop organizers.

Occasionally I manage to slip away from work and carry on a real life.
Here are some links of possible
interest (including pages I maintain).
