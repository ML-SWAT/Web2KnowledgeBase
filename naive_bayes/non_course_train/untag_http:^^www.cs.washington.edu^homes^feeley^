I am a sixth-year grad student; I am finishing up now and should be done soon.
My thesis concerns global memory management for workstation
clusters.  I also work on the 

Distributed Computing and 
 Opal
projects.  


I'll be joining the faculty at the 
 University of British Columbia in
January 1997.
