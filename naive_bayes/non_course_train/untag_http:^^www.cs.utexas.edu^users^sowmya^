Research

My research is in the area of Machine Learning in the field of
Artifical Intelligence. I am interested in the problem of learning
Bayesian networks from examples. Learning a Bayesian network with
hidden variables is a challenge. My approach is to apply 
symbolic and connectionist theory revision techniques to address this
problem.

I am also very interested in designing and creating multimedia
applications. 

Here is my resume,  and a list of my 
papers.
