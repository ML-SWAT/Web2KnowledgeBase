I'm 
getting my PhD 
here at the Computer Science Department
of the University of
Washington, in the wonderful city of  Seattle
.  Is it always raining here?  See for yourself, with this
up-to-date weather
report, or sneak a peek at this  live image from a video camera 
mounted outside.  The camera is pointed at our beautiful  Drumheller Fountain.  On a clear day, you
can catch a glimpse of 
Mt. Rainier  in all its glory (but this is probably not a clear
day, so here's a nice color picture).  


My Research

  So what am I doing here?  
 
 I'm developing the Web-Based Repository Manager,  which is a programming toolkit for building multi-media consoles.


 I'm constructing an image database as part of a
Structural Information Framework For Brain Mapping.



 We're building a knowledge base to support the  Digital Anatomist, an on-line interactive atlas of the human body.



 I implemented a Database
Environment for Vision Research.


 I'm a local expert on  persistent
programming languages.
