I am a professor in the 
Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the  University of Washington.  My principal
research interests are constraint-based languages and systems,
object-oriented languages, logic programming languages, human-computer
interaction, and computers and society.

Other Information

History ... I grew up in Idaho, and graduated from Reed College in 1971
with a B.A. in mathematics.  I did graduate work in computer science at
Stanford University, receiving an M.S. degree in 1974 and a Ph.D. in 1979.
My dissertation research, which was done in association with Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center, concerned a constraint-oriented simulation
laboratory.  After receiving my PhD, I spent a year as an NSF post-doctoral
fellow at the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland, working on mechanics problem solving and symbolic
algebra.  I joined the Computer Science Department at UW in 1980, and
except for a sabbatical spent at Xerox EuroPARC in Cambridge, England, have
been here since.
