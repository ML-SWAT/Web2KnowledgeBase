About me ...

I got my BS in Computer Science and MS in Theoretical Compuer Science, 
both from Tsinghua University 
-- one of the most prestige institutes in  China .
An incomplete

list of my undergraduate classmates is kept by 
Alex Zhao.


Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the 
Department of Computer Sciences at 
University of Texas at Austin.
My research interests are focused on VLSI CAD, where you can find many 
applications of mathematical sciences -- algorithm design and analysis,
combinatorial optimization, computational complexity,  even mathematical
logic. Our 
CAD for VLSI Research
Group is headed by Prof. Martin D.F. Wong.
