 Project Rocky: The Architectural Performance of Interpreted 
   Languages 

Project Description

  Interpreted languages have become increasingly popular over the last
  several years, due in part to the demands for portability, safety,
  and ease of use.  This project examines the performance of interpreted
  languages and environments from several perspectives: interpretation
  strategy, implementation, and processor/architecture utilization.
  As a basis for our study, we have collected a set of benchmarks and
  microbenchmarks which are implemented in several interpreted
  languages -- Perl, Tcl, Java, and MIPSI.  Using various
  instrumentation and tracing techniques, we evaluate the performance
  characteristics of those benchmarks in order to gain insight into
  the similarities and differences in these languages and their
  execution environments.

Java measurements on x86
Java source files for benchmarks


Tools

To collect information on the performance of x86 applications, we've
been building a binary rewriting tool called Etch.  Etch is not yet
publicly available, but you can read about it on the Etch
home page.
