       ACADEMIC INFORMATION 
  



  

      I am a graduate student in the 
      computer science department at the University of Washington.  My
      interests include software engineering, software specifications,
      specification usability and readability, and applications of formal
      methods to specifications.  The UW
      software safety web page describes my and others' work in these
      areas.  

      I have also dabbled in user interface design, human computer
      interaction, and Java programming.

    BACKGROUND
    



  
    I started graduate school in 1992 after completing a B.S. in computer
    science at UC Berkeley.  Before that I lived a lovely suburban life in
    Thousand Oaks, CA with my parents, sister, and a cat named Otis.
