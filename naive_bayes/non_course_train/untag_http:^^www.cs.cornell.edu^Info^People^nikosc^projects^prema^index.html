  Advanced Computing Research Institute,  Cornell Theory Center,  Cornell University 



Overview

  Prema is a runtime support system for parallel compilers and
problem solving environments that target scientific computing
applications. Prema is build on top of  PORTS (Cornell implementation)   and is designed to run on a variety of MPP and SMP computers. PREMA suppots:  

 
 global address space memory model 
 data and task parallel programming models 
  multi-threaded style of execution 
 
     automatic work-sharing mechanism (dynamic load balancing)  
 

 

 Papers
