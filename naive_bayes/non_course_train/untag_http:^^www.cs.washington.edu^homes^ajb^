I've just started computer science graduate school at the 
University of Washington
, so this page is still under construction.



I just graduated from 
Williams College with a BA in 
 computer science 
and  math .

  


When I'm not in front of a computer I'm playing 
ultimate frisbee.

 Information about the CRA Distributed Mentorship Project. 
The CRA Mentorship Project allows women undergraduates to spend a summer
working on research with a female mentor.  I had a great experience and highly
recommend this program!
