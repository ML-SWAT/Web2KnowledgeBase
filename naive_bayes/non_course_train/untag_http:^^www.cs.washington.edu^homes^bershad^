 Brian Bershad , Assistant Professor, has been at the University of
Washington since 1986.  After receiving his PhD from the University of
Washington in 1990, he took a brief respite from Seattle between 1990
and 1993 to experiment with post-industrial culture in the Northeast.
In 1993, he returned to the Northwest for the coffee.

Bershad does research in operating systems, distributed systems,
networking, parallel systems, and architecture.  A lot of his work has
appeared in TOCS, SOSP, ASPLOS and ISCA, although he can't seem to get a
SIGMETRICS paper published to save his life.  

Besides working, Bershad runs, plays squash, and hangs out on the
stairmaster.
