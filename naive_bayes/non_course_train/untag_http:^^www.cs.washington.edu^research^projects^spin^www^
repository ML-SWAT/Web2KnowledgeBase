 The SPIN Operating System


SPIN is an extensible operating system kernel that
supports the dynamic adaptation of system interfaces and
implementations through direct application control, while still
maintaining system integrity and inter-application isolation.

SPIN allows applications to load code into the kernel at
runtime. Because it runs in the kernel, this extension code can access
hardware and other operating systems services with with almost no
overhead (basically a procedure call), and data can be passed by
reference, rather than copied.  The SPIN kernel itself provides
a core set of interfaces and capabilities to basic resources.  These
are used by collections of extensions to implement general system
services such as address spaces, IPC, threads, and networking.  All
extension code (and most of the kernel) is written in the typesafe language Modula-3. The property of
typesafety prevents extensions from crashing the system by attempting
to manipulate arbitrary pieces of code or data. 

SPIN runs on DEC Alpha workstations. We're using it to write
both specialized applications such as network video systems, as well
as for supporting general purpose UNIX programs.


You can connect to a machine
running SPIN with the in-kernel SPIN web server 
 here.

 Quick Results 

This structure allows programs to extend operating system services with
low overhead. For example, with SPIN running on a 133 MHz Alpha,
an application can handle and recover from a page fault in 29 microseconds.
It takes 22 microseconds to create a new thread of control, execute
it, terminate, and synchronize with its termination (fork/join).  A protected
procedure call to another extension or to a kernel function takes .13
microseconds. A cross-machine RPC (application to application) over
ethernet takes under 600 microseconds; over ATM (on really old
adapters) it takes less than 450 microseconds. The same  operations
under Mach or DEC UNIX take up to 30 times longer on the same
hardware.  Time them yourself (or see our benchmarks page and save
yourself the effort).

Writing an Operating System Using Modula-3
 Describes our experiences using Modula-3 to build a high
     performance extensible system. Makes clear the distinction between a
     language and its implementation. 

 
Language Support for Extensible Operating Systems 
 We've been pretty happy with M3, but we've had to deal with a few
     shortcomings in order to use the language in a safe extensible
     operating system. This paper describes how we've addressed those
     shortcomings. 

 
Safe Dynamic Linking in an Extensible Operating System
 Describes the dynamic linker we use to load code into the kernel.
     Key point is the ability to create and manage linkable namespaces that
     describe interfaces and collections of interfaces.

 
Language and Runtime Support for Dynamic Interposition of System Code 
 Describes the kernel's internal communication and extension
     facilities. Shows use of dynamic code generation to improve the
     performance of a critical kernel service.
