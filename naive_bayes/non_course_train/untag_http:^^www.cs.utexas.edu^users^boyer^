UT's new and wonderful software licensing policy, which permits
the use of the Gnu Public License with close to zero administrative
overhead.  A short course on how
this works. And 
much more about intellectual property at UT.

 The
great books, various enumerations thereof. Ok, I confess to being a
canon thumper.


The possible ending of tenure at some U. S. universities



Standard disclaimer Naturally, nothing on my web pages should
be taken as representing the official position of the University of
Texas at Austin or any other part of the government of the State of
Texas.  (Furthermore, to steal a joke from Peter Deutsch, my having a
web page on a government-owned computer should not be taken as an
indication that I endorse everything that the government does.)

Formal methods have always been risky to use


``Peano was one of the first to use what we now call symbolic logic.
He introduced, for instance, the use of the symbols `(E x)' to mean
`there is an x such that'; and he habitually wrote out all of his
lecture notes in his new symbolism.  He was teaching at a military
academy at the time, and his students were so incensed by his
formalistic approach to mathematics that they rebelled (despite his
promises to pass them all) and got him fired.  Subsequently he found a
more congenial setting at the University of Turin.'' --  Gödel's
Incompleteness Theorems, Rudy Rucker, p. 289.



The Death of Fundamental Science?


"`Fundamental science is on the verge of extinction.' said Harold W.
Kroto of Britain's Sussex University, who shared the 1996 chemistry
prize with Robert F. Curl and Richard E. Smalley of Rice University in
Houston, for their discovery of carbon atoms bound in the shape of a
soccer ball." -- From the article "Scientists lament loss of funding,"
Associated Press, December 10, 1996, Daily Texan.
