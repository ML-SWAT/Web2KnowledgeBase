My lovely wife

Corina is 
currently in her third year of the graduate program in the 

Political Science
here at 

U of W.


 
I'm in my third year in the graduate program at the
Computer Science 
Department at the University of
Washington, slaving away toward the lofty goal of my Ph.D.  
   
I completed his undergraduate
degree at the  University of California at San Diego  with an
odd double-major in Computer Science and Political Science.

I'm going on leave from graduate school in mid-December and I'm
actively looking for a position in software development.  If you're interested, you can check out my 

resume.




Java Applets:



WebView allows you to see the links to and from a page or
set of pages.  






There are two new additions to the WebView family, AltaVistaWebView
and MetaWebView.  Instead of entering a URL, you enter keywords for
AltaVista or Metacrawler and WebView hits the search service,
returning a graph displaying all the pages found by the search
services with the links between those pages.  















 The 
Automated Travel Assistant emulates the dialog between a travel
agent and client, gradually eliciting your flight preferences while
allowing you to browse real flight data.  It's a research prototype,
but it has quite a bit of functionality even at this early stage.






ATA  and 

WebView   
have been highly rated by 

Gamelan and
JARS.  

ATA 
was
rated "Top 1% of Java applets" by JARS, "What's Cool" by Gamelan, and
was a Gamelan staff pick. 

WebView 
was
rated "Top 5% of Java applets" by JARS, "What's Cool" by Gamelan, and
was a Gamelan staff pick.













 
...and a Gamelan Staff Pick!




And 

AltaVistaWebView 
was one of the winners of the

Java Repository Java Contest! 





My applets have also been published in two books:

A. Walsh, Foundations of Java, IDG Books, 1996
Le Meilleur de Java (The Best of Java), 1996



Here's my first Java applet, Linear Ballet.





Oops!  You're not using a Java-capable browser.  Sorry.  No cool Java applets for you. 





The source demonstrates using double-buffering to avoid flicker and using threads to give time to other running applets.  The code certainly could be cleaner, though, so don't expect a work of art here.
 
If you thought that was cool, you might have low enough standards
to be impressed by my

LGrammer or 

Particle Tree
 applets.
Both draw trees.  The LGrammer trees look much more realistic than the
ParticleTree trees, but both are interesting. 



 
I recently started a position as a 

JARS judge, evaluating the Java applets that are submitted to the

JARS archive.  Very interesting work.

In the summer of 1995, I developed Dawn of Civilization, a
demonstration application showing that planning techniques can
successfully be applied in entertainment software, for Myriad
Software.  

At UCSD, I worked with Professor Rik Belew and Filippo Menzer on the
 Latent
Energy Environments (LEE)  project, a tool for developing
artificial life models and experimenting with artificial neural
network and evolutionary learning in software enviroments.

Adam Carlson,

Sujay Parekh, and I wrote a fun
ray tracer 
as one of
the projects in

CS557 (graduate computer graphics).  Here's some of the images...

 The Headless Horseman
 Closeup of the Headless Horseman
 Chess Duel
 Some Assembly Required
 Spheres, an image with
reflection, transparency, shadows, distributed ray tracing, adaptive
sampling, and a mess of other cool things.  The patterns on the
spheres are because they're both transparent and reflective, causing
the rays to reflect and refract multiple times both from the surface
and internally.  


We also made a 90 second computer animation called "The Strike".  The
animation was written using SGI Inventor and C code to manipulate the
3D models.  The original SGI movie file was 70mb.  We have made a

lower quality
27.5mb QuickTime movie
 available and a 

very low quality 6.5mb
QuickTime movie available.  Sorry, it just doesn't compress any
further than this (at least with anything resembling reasonable quality).
