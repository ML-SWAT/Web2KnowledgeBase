 CS Stuff 
I'm currently looking at memory system performance.  In particular, different
memory system organizations are being investigated.  This work is being
done with  Jean-Loup Baer.


I am also looking at interpreters with others (
 Dennis, 
 Ted, 
 Geoff, and
 Alec).  Right
now, things are a little  rocky.
Actually, we have an early version of our paper. 


 Things that I keep jumping to


    DEC's Alpha 



 Interesting places to go fishing? 



I don't have a list of cool sites.  However, I have a list of people
who have a list of people who do (well, not yet).
