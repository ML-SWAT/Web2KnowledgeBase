  Summary of Research 

The main objective of our research is to design and implement an
end-to-end system architecture for enabling a wide range of
distributed multimedia applications. Specifically, we are developing:
(1) an integrated multimedia file system, (2) algorithms and protocols
for efficient transmission of digital audio and video over networks,
and (3) large-scale multimedia databases.
