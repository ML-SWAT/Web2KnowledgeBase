Hi there!
Welcome to my home page! My name is Funda Ergun. I am a Ph.D. student
in the Computer Science Dept. here in Cornell. I am working on  program
checking with Prof. Ronitt Rubinfeld. Here is my 
research

page. 
I am also doing a minor on 
painting in the department of fine arts. 

I originally come from Izmir, Turkey. I did my undergrad in Bilkent
University in  Ankara, Turkey. 
 
 
I have some non research related 

stuff  here, but you should be warned that you might encounter
pages written in Turkish or angry dogs if you go there! Go at your own risk!
