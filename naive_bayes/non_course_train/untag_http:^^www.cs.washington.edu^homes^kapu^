I'm a third year graduate student in the Computer Science & Engineering
Department at the University of
Washington, working on my Ph.D.


I'm interested both in Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, and
Mathematics, and I'm trying to combine aspects from all these
disciplines in my research. 

The professors in our department I work closest with are Tony
Derose (graphics) [he's actually not here any more, but left UW
for Pixar] and Linda
Shapiro (vision). Additionally I work with Werner Stuetzle and
John McDonald (statistics), Tom Duchamp (mathematics), and
Hugues Hoppe and Rick Szeliski (Microsoft research).


I did my quals project TRIBORS: Triplet-Based Object Recognition
System while working as an RA for Linda, my report is a Technical Report 95-01-01
of the Department of Computer Science & Engineering in the University
of Washington.

Currently I'm working on surface
reconstruction from range data. We have a multiple-baseline camera
system for obtaining data, we use subdivision surfaces and wavelet
analysis for surface geometry and reflectance functions.
 
I just passed my General Examination, where the topic was Rigid
Registration of 3D data. Click here to find out more about it.



Some class projects from my 2nd year at UW 

CSE 548, Computer Architecture
Systems, the class was taught by Susan
Eggers.



CSE 552, Distributed Computing, the
class was taught by Brian
Bershad.




CSE 576, Image Understanding, the
class was taught by Steven Tanimoto
.


I presented two Technical Sketches in SIGGRAPH '96. You can get
to my slides on 

subdivision surfaces

 and to my slides on 

removing wavelets

.
