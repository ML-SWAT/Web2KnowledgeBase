Business

My resume (postscript).

In Spring 1996 I had to give a report to my
	EE382C ("Software for Highly-Available Distributed
	Systems") class.  The slides talk about
	efforts to use
	
	RT-Mach to implement some of 
	
	Flaviu Cristian's distributed
	algorithms (work done for 
	
	Prof. Al Mok; built on some work by 
	Guangtian Liu).

I am currently working on a hardware verification project at 
IBM in the
RS/6000 division.
It ties in with my Ph.D research under Professor 
Allen Emerson.


Pleasure

Domestic bliss department:  
	photos of my wife Carla and our newborn
	daughter Ruth Claire (3/13/96).

Before parenthood struck, travel and beer were high priorities.
        Somewhere between the two lies the enjoyment I get from peeling
	beer labels off of bottles in foreign
	lands.


Humor from various sources

The 
	Sofasphere II project.
Some haikus about Olestra, the new
	FDA-approved fat substitute.
Speaking of poetry... here is an interesting ode to 
	women.
Some disinformation about 
	Bob Dole.
