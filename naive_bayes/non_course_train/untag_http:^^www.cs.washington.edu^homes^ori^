Hi,



I'm a second year graduate student at the University of
Washington.  

Before moving to Seattle, I lived in California for seven years:  four
years at Berkeley and three years in Lancaster (northeast of Los Angeles).
I am originally from Israel, where I lived at Haifa, Bat-Yam and Holon.
For fun I like to practice Tae Kwon Do, play basketball, and go hiking.



This quarter I'm taking one class, a whole bunch of seminars, and am
TAing 
CSE378 -- Computer Architecture.  You can usually find me at my office
(233 Sieg) when I'm not in class.  My office hours for CSE378 are
Monday 1:30-2:20 and Wednesday 3:30-4:20.



Potential employers are welcome to look at my 
 resume .



Here are a few 

pictures  I took last summer.  Click

program called Virtual Reality.
