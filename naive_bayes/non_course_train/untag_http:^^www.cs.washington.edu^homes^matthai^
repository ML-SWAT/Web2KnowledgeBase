I'm working on the Dynamic Compilation Project.  The dynamic compiler
is a beast that generates/optimizes code at runtime. In the short
term, I'm interested in figuring out how to produce good code 
dynamically  (i.e. at runtime) for modern processor architectures. On the applications side, I think interpreter-based
systems with real-time constraints, like the Hot Java web browser, can
benefit from selective runtime compilation. I'd like to wire up such a
system to a runtime compiler and see how it goes. I'm working with
Professors  Susan Eggers
and   Craig Chambers.
