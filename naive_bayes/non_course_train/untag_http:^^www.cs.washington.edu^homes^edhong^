Did you know that I'm a second year graduate computer science student
at the University of Washington?  Well I am.  And that's all I have to
say about that.

For those business type people with little time on their hands, I had
to include my resume link at the top, in postcript
and in plain text form.



My office: room 233 Seig Hall; (206)543-7798. 
My current home: (206) 244-1261

Currently, I'm working with Anna Karlin and Craig Chambers on a 
theoretical model for dynamic compilation. More specifically, I'm working
on developing an on-line algorithm that will work well for
dynamic compilation. I plan this to be my quals project.

My  Sister
 wanted a home page, so I helped her create one. I also have a list 
of various people that I know, on 
another web page.


One of my interests includes keeping up on the computer industry. 
These sites give insightful commentary on what's happening. If you know
of any other such places, please mail 
 me.

I own a Power Macintosh, so I guess that makes me biased towards
liking macs. However, I think better computers that are even
easier to use have yet to come....



Here are places that are I sometimes visit:

 CNN
 Apple Computer


 
        check the Seattle freeway traffic

 
        look for advice in the most important book in the world



Here's some useful information that I always wanted to know but just found... 


 find an address in the U. S.
  domain names

    - find out what country your e-mail friends are in. What does .se stand for?
