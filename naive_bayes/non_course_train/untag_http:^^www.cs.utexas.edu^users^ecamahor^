 About my Promise of Setting up a Decent! Home Page After the Summer 



Mmmmm!? After multiple complaints about me not meeting my previous 
home page deadline ..... 



I have come up with another excuse .... :^) :^)



You know .... I HAVE TO get my SIGGRAPH paper finished by January,
15th ....



So that's the only thing I can think 'bout right now ....



And no, I won't make any more promises this time .....



Or else, I'll lose the credibility I have left ..... if any .....
