  Hello, and welcome to my WWW homepage.
Please feel free to send  feedback
 to the above email address.  This page is (and always will be, I
suppose) under construction so keep checking back for new and exciting
features.

 I'm a recent graduate of  Duke
University.  I completed my B.S. degree as a double major in
computer science and mathematics in the spring of 1995.  I am
currently employed part-time as a senior research scientist for
Transworld Numerics, Inc., a small company originally located in
Durham, NC, with its headquarters in Bermuda.  I now work from my
apartment in Seattle,
Washington. I am also a full time graduate student in the computer
science and engineering department at the University of
Washington.
