  What I Do  

I am a graduate student in 
 Computer Science  at the 
 University of Texas at Austin. 

I am interested in network and operating system support for 
 multimedia  
systems and work in the 
 Distributed Multimedia
Computing Laboratory  
headed by 
 Dr. Harrick Vin 
here at UT.  My 
 research 
is supervised by Dr. Vin and 
 Dr. Greg Lavender 
at the 
 
ISODE Consortium.
