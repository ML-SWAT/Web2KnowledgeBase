Research Information

I am a member of the  OOPS Research Group in 
the  Department of Computer Sciences at 
The University of Texas at Austin.


As part of my Ph.D. research, I am building a real-time garbage
collector for C and C++.  In addition, I am performing a number of
studies on memory allocation routines.  A postscript copy of my  dissertation
proposal (641K) is available.



For more information, please see my list
of publications (along with brief descriptions). 

 

I have developed a C++ class library that allows for the very precise timing
of routines on an Intel(tm) Pentium running Linux.  This code is
 publicly available.





Here is some Fun Stuff (not related to my research).
