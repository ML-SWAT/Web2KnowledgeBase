Research Interests

My current research interests in artificial intelligence are primarily
in the area of machine learning.  They include:

 Natural Language Acquisition: Learning parsers, lexicons,
     information extraction, and word sense disambiguation from examples.
 Inductive Logic Programming: Learning Prolog programs from examples. 
 Knowledge-Base and Theory Refinement: Automatically modifying rule bases and Bayesian networks 
     to fit empirical data.  
 Search-Control Acquisition: Learning to improve planning efficiency and quality.
 Comparing and combining neural-network and symbolic learning.

Personal History

I grew up in the 60's and 70's in the small town of O'Fallon Illinois where
starting in 1975 I attended  O'Fallon
Township Highschool. Starting in the fall of 1979, I went to the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana
to obtain all of the degrees listed above. In December 1987, I completed my
Ph.D. thesis in the Explanation-Based Learning
Group under the direction of Prof.
Gerald Dejong and then began my position here in The Department of Computer Sciences at the  The University of Texas at Austin.
