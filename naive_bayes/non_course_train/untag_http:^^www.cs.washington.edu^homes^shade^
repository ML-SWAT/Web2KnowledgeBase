Greetings and salutations. I'm a third year grad student here
at u-dub
cse. Interactive rendering
of complex 3D scenes is currently my thing. If it is your thing too,
then follow the Projects link to the 
Walkthru
project. There, among
lots of pictures and animations, you'll find the SIGGRAPH 96 paper
describing some recent work. ( As a shortcut, you can click on the
picture of the island in the lower left corner of this page.)

There is lots of interesting work going on in many different aspects
of computer graphics here. The

Graphics and Imaging Laboratory is where most of it gets done.
