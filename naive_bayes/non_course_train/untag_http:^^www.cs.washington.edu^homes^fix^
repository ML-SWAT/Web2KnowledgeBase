Schedule
This quarter (autumn '96) I am not TAing any courses,
but rather working on my Generals Exam.
You can check out my schedule
to see what I'm up to.  Otherwise, if I'm not around, I can probably
be found in the library or somewhere nice reading papers.



Research Activities
My main interest is in computer algorithms, specifically in the areas
of parallel computation and computational geometry.
