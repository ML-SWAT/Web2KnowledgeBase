The Horus Project



















































The Company of
the Gods rejoiced, rejoiced, at the coming of Horus, the son of Osiris,
whose heart was firm, the triumphant, the son of
Isis, the heir of Osiris.
















The Horus project has developed a modular and extensible process-group
communication system, 
addressing the requirements of a wide variety 
of robust distributed applications.















Horus, the son of Isis and of Osiris, was a god whose attributes appealed
strongly to the Egyptians from one end of Egypt to the other, because
in him every man and woman saw the type of what he or she wished to possess,
that is to say, renewed life, and life as opposed to death, and movement
as opposed to inactivity.







 

Horus provides a framework for the development of distributed applications
based on group communications, a style of computing that can arise in
fault-tolerant systems, managed distributed systems, applications that
exploit data replication or coherent caching, and groupware. Within the
overall Horus framework a large collection of system and application
protocols have been developed that allow the application designer to
construct a communication module that exactly meets the application
requirements at minimal cost. 

The Horus project was originally launched as an effort to redesign  the
Isis group
communication system, but has evolved into a general purpose communication
architecture with advanced support for the development of robust
distributed systems in settings for which Isis was unsuitable, such as
applications that have special security or real-time requirements. Besides
the practical uses of our software, the project has contributed 
towards the theory of virtually synchrony, a runtime model used
for our implementation of data replication and fault-tolerance.   At the same
time, our software is much faster and lighter weight than the Isis system.

Horus exists as two systems: an initial version coded in C, which can be
used for research purposes at no fee but has restricted commerical
rights,
and a new version called Ensemble, written in ML but usable from many
other languages, which  is available for all classes of users at no
fee.  Ensemble is actively under development and we will do series of
releases over the fall of 1996 and spring of 1997.  By early in
1997, Ensemble
will be an outstanding environment for building Java-based groupware
applications that do multimedia conferencing on the Web.

Horus and Ensemble are designed to be platform independent, and are
available for different
classes of workstations, personal computers, parallel processors and on
next-generation cluster environments using standard high-speed
communications networks. 

The Horus effort collaborates closely with many other distributed systems
projects, including Transis, NavTech, and the StormCast and TACOMA
projects. Links to these and other projects can be found elsewhere in these
pages.
