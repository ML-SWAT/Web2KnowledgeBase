Academic interests
I would call myself an applied 

theoretical computer scientist.
My current work is in 
computational biology.
At the moment I am looking at the problem of 
physical mapping; building a rough map of the location of landmarks in
a genome.  Generally speaking I am interested in using CS theory and math to
solve reasonably practical problems. I have also done some work in
computational astrophysics with the 
HPCC/ESS group
here at UW.
