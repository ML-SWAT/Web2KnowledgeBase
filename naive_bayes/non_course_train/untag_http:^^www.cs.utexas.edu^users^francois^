About Me


Current research interests :

 is the black forest cake at central market genuine ?
 where can I find real pastries and fruit mousses in Austin ?
 does ******* pack groceries as well as *** swims ?


A forthcoming trip to 
central market should shed some light
on these very interesting research issues.
 
Central market is your one stop shopping for food,
fun and women.

Current research non-interests :

 Have fun ! Crawl in the mud ! Join the foreign legion !
 Today's 

chinese wisdom 







Suggestions :



Watch me play  basketball 
Go to Hyogo, Japan. Check out some 

tank police 

action at

Dominion Tank Police HQ

Check out 
Today's Dilbert




I knew this database class would be nothing but trouble. Not to mention
that parallel computing class.
