  That's me, in my Navy uniform.  Currently I am a Master of Engineering student in Computer Science at the College of
Engineering, Cornell University.  This semester I am a teaching assistant for COMS 664 Machine Vision.  During the day (and many, many long nights), I can be found in the 
Robotics and Vision Lab (CSRVL), where I am a research assistant
working for 
Prof. Ramin Zabih.  My primary research interest is
Machine Vision, particularly low-level image processing.
