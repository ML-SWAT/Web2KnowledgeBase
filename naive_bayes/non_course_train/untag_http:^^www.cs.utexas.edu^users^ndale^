University of Texas Computer Science Department

Welcome to my home page.  You have reached the web address of Dr. Nell B.
Dale, retired Senior Lecturer in Computer Sciences at the University of
Texas at Austin.  I received my Ph.D. in Computer Sciences in 1972 from UT
Austin and have been on the faculty here since 1975. I retired from
full-time teaching in the summer of 1994. I now teach a full load each Fall
and spend the Spring and Summer writing and traveling.


Please feel free to browse in any of my rooms: the resume room, which contains my curriculum vita, the bibliography room, which contains information on the text books I have authored or co-authored, the research room, which contains abstracts of
dissertations that I have co-chaired recently, and the personal room, which
contains mementos of my nontechnical interests.
Please direct any
