Academic Interests


Graphical user interfaces, human-computer interaction, educational software, 
Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), computer graphics,
visualization techniques, and visual programming languages. 


 

Current Work 
I am currently working with Steve
Tanimoto and 
Lauren Bricker on the 

CoImage project.  We have devleoped some collaborative educational 
activities in order to explore the use of cooperatively contolled objects.
The goal of my work is to investigate different ways that multiple users can
simultaneously share and manipulate a given object, and ways of assessing 
their interactions.



I also work part-time at  Ark Interface, a Packard Bell Company.
