 Research 

I am interested in modeling cortical structures in Neural Networks.
Currently, I am working on a hand-written digit recognition system
based on lateraly interconnected synergetically self organizing feature map(LISSOM:developed by
 Joseph Sirosh and 
 Prof. Risto Miikkulainen  
at  UTCS Neural Networks Research 
Group . Recent work includes extending the LISSOM model to have actual
spiking events. The new model called Spiking LISSOM (SLISSOM) can be
self-organized as LISSOM and can segment multiple objects in the retina
by synchronizing spikes within a group representing the same object,
and desynchronizing spikes between groups representing different objects.
