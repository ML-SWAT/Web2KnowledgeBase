 I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Sciences at
the  University of Texas at
Austin.  I am planning to complete my Ph.D. in Spring 1997.  My
dissertation supervisor is Greg
Plaxton.  



 

Research: I am a member of the UT Algorithms and
Computational Theory Group.  I am particularly interested in
combinatorics, distributed network algorithms, online algorithms,
parallel models of computation, and randomness.  Here are a list of my
publications and my curriculum vita.
