	In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there is nothing
	left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
	




I am involved with two of the major systems projects at the Cornell Computer Science Department: The

Horus
and the 
 Cornell ATM Cluster Projects. I think my
research interests are best described by: 


	
	Low latency and high bandwith communication support for 
	highly reliable distributed systems with real time requirments.
	


I focus on the system design and engineering issues. Some of the things I am
working on:

A highly predictable execution environment for Horus. The integration of Horus
with some Real-Time environments needs to lead to a situation where we can 
reason about advanced operational guarantees.

Mechanisms for efficient data transfers between high-speed 
network devices and the application level. Low latency for all messages 
and high bandwidth with small messages are two issues that 
have fallen behind in the software design for high-speed network adapters.

High-speed Cluster Communication protocols. Once you achieve the desired low-latency
for your message passing system, you will see that your old protocols
are not able to exploit this, and you will need to re-think their structure
and interaction patterns.

Methods for dealing with guarantee failures (aka 
missed deadline support). It is not bad to not be able to meet the 
guarantes you gave, it is bad to not tell anyone about it.

Acurate Failure Detection. If we want to take our distributed systems to a
global scope, there is a need to find a generic mechanism to support
failure suspision, detection and management of processes, nodes and networks.
From our experience with group systems we can extract a mechanism that will work
with any middleware package, regardless of its functionality.


Horus is the brainchild of  

Robbert van Renesse  and

Ken Birman. The ATM Cluster work is done cooperation with

Thorsten von Eicken and the Multimedia & Video-On-Demand Horus
experiments are in concert with 

Brian Smith.

I am responsible for 
CS 515, 
 a Practicum in Distributed Systems, and teach a number of lectures
on network protocols and high-speed network technology in 
CS 514: 
Practical Distributed Systems.
