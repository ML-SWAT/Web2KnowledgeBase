Software generation is a key to improved programmer productivity, reduced 
maintenance costs, and enhanced application performance. I and my students 
are investigating ways to realize practical, domain-specific component-based 
design methodologies and technologies for large scale software system 
synthesis. This spans the topics of: software architectures, design patterns, 
extensible languages, subjectivity, domain modeling, parameterized 
programming, object-oriented programming, frameworks. The domains of 
current interest are database management, data structures, and avionics.
My current research is building a programming language to support software 
generation. The goal of the Jakarta Project is to build an extensible preprocessor for the Java language. 
Domain-specific generators would be encapsulated, pluggable extensions to Jakarta.
Research funding is from DARPA, Microsoft Research, the University of Texas Applied Research 
Laboratories, and Schlumberger.
