Research

Sequential decision tasks appear in many practical real-world problems
including control, resource allocation, and routing.  Such tasks can
be characterized by the following scenario: An agent observes a state
of a dynamic system and selects from a finite set of actions.  The
system then enters a new state upon which the agent must select
another action.  The system may return a payoff for each decision made
or for a sequence of decisions.  The objective is to select the
sequence of actions that return the highest total or cumulative
payoff.  In my research, I evolve Neural Networks with Genetic
Algorithms to learn and perform sequential decision tasks.  I am
particularly interested in tasks where problem-specific knowledge is
currently unavailable or costly to obtain.  Some domains that I have
studied include game playing, intelligent control, and constraint
satisfaction.  For more information, see my  list of publications.
