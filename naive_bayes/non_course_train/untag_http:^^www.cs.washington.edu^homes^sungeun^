MY
SCHOOL
LIFE






My primary research interest is in compiling 
parallel programming 
languages.  I am involved in the ZPL
Compiler Project at the University of Washington.  Lately, I've been
spending most of my time thinking about optimized communication
generation using the ZPL architechture-independent communication
library, IRONMAN.
In addition, I am experimenting with simulating data parallel programs
on superscalar processors.  The goal of this work is to improve node
performance on the coming generations of parallel machines.  I've also
been seen hanging out with the Chaos
Router group.  I did a bit of work on the simulator,
including a graphical front end for visualization.  With that
experience, I am currently implementing another router simulator in
ZPL.  Finally, I am also doing a little bit of astronomy.



This quarter, I am TAing CSE 451.







I enjoy watching  movies,
but mostly in the comfort of my own home.  I like to eat (oh yeah,
I've been a vegetarian since my
junior year in college) and drink (dinner would not be the same
without a good 
wine.)  As a result, I must exercise quite a bit.  I play on two
soccer
teams: Cousin Scrubs (Co-Rec division 9A) and Cooper's (Co-Rec
division 2A).  Last season, the Scrubs came in second place (9B) and
Cooper's won their division (4B).  Unfortunately, I recently sacrified
my left knee for the game, and won't playing soccer or taking my usual
step aerobics
class.  Instead, you may find me at the IMA trying to swim and at a weight training
class.  Like all good people in this world, I try to read a few  books, take in a
bit of 
Shakespeare, watch public
television, and listen to classical
music.
