 Interesting random stuff 

Coming soon!  Stay tuned!. 



 Research 

I am interested in issues of security in distributed systems.  At present I
am studying formalisms (e.g. BAN logic) for developing and analyzing authentication
protocols.

I have done some work in the use of formal methods for synthesis, 
specification and verification of parallel and distributed systems.  I am
working on a paper on the synthesis of resource controllers that communicate
with their clients by means of queued messages.  (For a draft of this paper,
see "Synthesis of Distributed Control Systems".)

In addition, I am a student research assistant at Applied Research Laboratories.  I am currently working a project to investigate using evolutionary computation techniques (e.g. genetic algorithms) to develop finite state machines.  For more information on this project, click here.

My resume is available here in both HTML and PostScript formats.
