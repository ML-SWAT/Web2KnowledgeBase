Research
The title of my dissertation is
 "Flow Routing in Computer Networks".
My research interests lie in the areas of network protocols, distributed 
computing, fault-tolerance, and in particular self-stabilizing systems.
 

Implicit in the design of any system is a labeling of its
states as "legitimate" or "illegitimate". We identify as "legitimate" 
those states which occur under the correct (intended) execution of a system.
All other states are considered "illegitimate". 
A system is said to be self-stabilizing when
regardless of its initial state, it is guaranteed to converge to
a legitimate state in a finite number of steps. A system
which is not self-stabilizing may stay in an illegitimate state 
forever.
