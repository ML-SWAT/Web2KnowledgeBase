Doug Stuart's Home Page


Welcome!

This page is under construction (what page isn't), so bear with me.
I am not sure what I will put here, but for now, there are a number of

links

to interesting places, as well as some information about

Sports

,

science fiction

,

books

in general, and a few

jokes

(test
of latex2html), or a

weather map

and

conditions at Austin
and

New Orleans

.
I guess I am sort of using this as my own personal archive, and am
graciously sharing it with the web.  I'm not sure why, but I'm doing it.
Perhaps because the linking process provides me with an index, and putting
it all here is just as simple as keeping it to myself, and the web
browser provides a useful database browser as well.  I don't know if this
is a good idea or not, but if I'm going to save something, it is just
as easy to save it in a web accessible manner.
