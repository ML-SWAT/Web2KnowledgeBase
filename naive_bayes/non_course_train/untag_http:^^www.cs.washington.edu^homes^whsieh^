Wilson C. Hsieh




I am a postdoc in the
Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the
University of Washington (in

Seattle,
WA).  I am a member of the
SPIN project.


I received my PhD from the
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
in the
School of Engineering
at
MIT, where I worked in the
Laboratory for Computer Science.
My advisors were
Frans Kaashoek
and
Bill Weihl.


Most of my research has been in compilation and parallel systems.  My
research interests lie in the interactions among compilers, programming
languages, runtime and operating systems, and architectures.
