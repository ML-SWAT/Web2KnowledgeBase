Dissertation Research

I am working with Professor J.C. Browne on the design and
implementation of device control software (a.k.a. device drivers).  
We are investigating the creation of a domain-specific 
programming environment for constructing this class of 
software.


The focus of our work thus far has been on language and compiler 
technologies.  We have devised a prototype domain-specific language for 
specifying device control softare called VDL (Virtual Device Language).  
This language contains various features for reducing the effort 
required to construct this class of software.  A reference manual
for VDL is currently being constructed.  A  
postscript draft  of the manual is available for viewing.  
Example VDL specifications are also available for viewing.


VDL specifications for the 8253 Counter Component are available in 
the following files:

  c8253.pcn  (physical component interface file) 
  c8253.vcm  (virtual component implementation file) 
  c8253.vcx  (virtual component export file) 
  c8253.vcn  (virtual component interface file) 


VDL specifications for the PC-LPM-16 Multifunction I/O Device are 
available in the following files:

  lpm.pdn  (physical device interface file) 
  lpm.vdm  (virtual device implementation file) 
  lpm.vdx  (virtual device export file) 
  lpm.vdn  (virtual device interface file) 


 Transparencies  used in a recent presentation 
are also available for viewing.  They were created using Microsoft PowerPoint
Version 7.0b for Windows 95.
