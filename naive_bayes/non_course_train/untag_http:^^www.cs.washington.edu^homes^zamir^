I am an Israeli  graduate student at the department of Computer
Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. My
undergraduate degree is in physics and mathematics from the Hebrew
University, Jerusalem, Israel.

My interests are in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Software
Engineering. Currently I'm working on On-line Clustering algorithms
for Internet document retrievals. The basic idea is to help the user
with Internet searches resulting in hundreds of documents. This work
is done as part of the MetaCrawler
 - a parallel Web search service, along with 
Oren
Etzioni and 
Erik Selberg.





My Resume is available here.
