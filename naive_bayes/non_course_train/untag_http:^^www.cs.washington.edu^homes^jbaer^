I'm currently a graduate student in 
Computer Science
at the 
University of Washington.

My CS interests include artificial intelligence, human-computer
interaction, multimedia educational software, software engineering
tools, and computer generated music.

Here's some more personal/creative stuff.


Other cool places I spend some significant time at:


Pierian Spring Software


Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)
 Pomona College



Here's a look at some current projects of mine:

 Eight-Puzzle Java Applet 
(a work in progress)
 Experimental Virtual Travel Applet
 Copy Effects Demo Applet
 Questioner Project
 Static Layer Analysis for C Programs
                


Feeling stressed out?  Here's a really silly little DA for the Macintosh that
I wrote years ago.
 Download it if you'd like.
