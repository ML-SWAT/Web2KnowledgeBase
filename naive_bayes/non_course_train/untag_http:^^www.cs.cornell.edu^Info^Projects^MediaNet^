Cornell MediaNet Project



MediaNet: A High Performance Platform for Network Media Processing 

MediaNet combines 3 technologies developed by researchers at Cornell to
develop a flexible, high performance testbed for storing, transporting, 
processing, and using multimedia data.  MediaNet combines:


 U-Net: User level network architecture.
User level access to the network dramatically improves performance 
and facilitates the development of new communication protocols
The order-of-magnitude improvement in LAN communication
makes parallel computations on workstation clusters practical.


  CM-Horus: Group communication
primitives for multimedia.
We are adapting an industrial strength group communication tool, Horus,
to multimedia applications.
Such secure and reliable group communication primitives are critical for
advanced military and commercial multimedia applications


 CMT: Toolkit approach for 
reliable distributed audio/video applications.
CMT is a portable toolkit for building applications that include
audio and video, facilitating the rapid prototyping of multimedia
applications. 




Funding for the project is provided under contract N00014-95-1-0799 from
