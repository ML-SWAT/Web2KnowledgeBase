Research Interests

The research in my group concentrates on modeling cognitive processes
with artificial neural networks. Current work includes models of language
acquisition, episodic memory, self-organization of the visual cortex,
and schema-based vision.  We are also working on evolving neural networks
with genetic algorithms, where the goal is to automatically discover
sequential decision strategies for problem solving and robotics.
