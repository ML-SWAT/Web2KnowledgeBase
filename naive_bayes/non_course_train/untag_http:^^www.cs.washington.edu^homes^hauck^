I'm a 5th year graduate student at the University of Washington.
I am currently working on Multi-FPGA Systems and Rapid-Prototyping of 
Board-Level Designs, though
I am also interested in Asynchronous Circuits, FPGA Architectures, and 
Parallelism.  I should graduate in June of 1995.

Research




 
Asynchronous Circuits
	 Survey of current asynchronous design methodologies, as
	well as the first FPGA for asynchronous circuits.

 
Triptych/Montage FPGA Architectures
	 Development of the Triptych and Montage FPGA 
	architectures, architectures with improved densities over current 
	commercial FPGAs.

 

Multi-FPGA Systems & Rapid-Prototyping
	 Development of the Springbok Rapid-Prototyping System for
	Board-Level Designs, as well as partitioning, pin assignment,
	and routing topology work for general multi-FPGA systems.

 
The Chinook Project
	 A Hardware/Software Co-design, Co-synthesis, and Co-simulation
	system for embedded applications.
