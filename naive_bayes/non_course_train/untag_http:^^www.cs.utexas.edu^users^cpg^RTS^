UTCS Real-Time Systems Research Group







The Real-Time Systems research group is headed by
Prof. Aloysius Mok.
In the past few years, we have worked towards laying the groundwork
for establishing a firm theoretical foundation for real-time systems
and also to build design tools based on this foundation. Our work can
be categorized into three areas as follows:


	Specification and Modeling: precise formulation of real-time properties of systems.

	Analysis and Verification: reasoning about real-time properties.

        Synthesis: enforcing stringent  timing  constraints  and other real-time properties.
