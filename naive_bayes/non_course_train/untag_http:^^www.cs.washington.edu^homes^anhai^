Hi, I was born and brought up in Vietnam.  After finishing high school in 1987, I
went to Hungary to study Computer Science.  I graduated from Kossuth Lajos University of Arts and
Sciences, Debrecen, Hungary, with a B.S. in 1993, and received a
M.S. -- also in Computer Science -- from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in
1995. Starting Fall 1996, I am in the Ph.D.  program at the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering, University of
Washington-Seattle.

My research interests are mostly in Artificial Intelligence.  I am
currently investigating decision making under
uncertainty, decision-theoretic planning, Markov decision processes,
and qualitative decision theory. Non-academic interests include reading, traveling,
and listening to music (mostly jazz and blues).

An interesting thing about my first name, AnHai (meaning "calm sea" in
Vietnamese): It is made by combining the last syllable of the name of
my mother's birthplace, NgheAn, and the first syllable of the name of
my father's birthplace, HaiPhong. This shows how creative my folks
were. Or so I thought up to the birth of my younger brother, when they
simply switched the two syllables and gave him the name
HaiAn. Hmm...
