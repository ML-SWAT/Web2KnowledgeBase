  About Me...
    
	I'm a graduate student in  
	Department of Computer Science  at
        
        The University of Texas at
        Austin.
          I got my B.S degree in 
        physics from  
        Peking University in 
         China . 
	Peking University is the 
   	top one university in China, and has the most 
	 
	beautiful campus.
         Before I came to Austin,
        I stayed in  Miami 
        for almost three years doing research on 
	 Marine Physics at
	 University of Miami. 
	I had so much fun there.
	 Here come my wonderful wife 
	and my cool MuStang.
