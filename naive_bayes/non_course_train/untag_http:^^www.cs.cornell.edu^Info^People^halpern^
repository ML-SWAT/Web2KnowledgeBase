My research focuses on reasoning about knowledge and uncertainty, 
and its applications to distributed computing, AI, and game theory,
 although I've also done work (and continue to be interested in) such 
topics as fault tolerance in distributed computing 
programming language semantics.
My work lies at the boundary of a number of fields. 
I recently gave a talk in the economics department at Princeton where 
I described myself as someone with a Ph.D. in mathematics, who calls 
himself a computer scientist, and is giving a talk to economists about
a subject mainly studied by philosophers.  
That's probably the best one-sentence description I can give.  

If you'd like more details,
check my 

 list of publications.

It has pointers to abstracts of all my papers; in many cases, the paper itself is also available.  Other details of my activities are in my  

 resume.


In Fall, 1996, I'm teaching a course on 

 Reasoning About Knowledge (COM S 676). 

 In the fall of 1997, I'll teach a sequel on 

 Reasoning About Uncertainty (COM S 677).
