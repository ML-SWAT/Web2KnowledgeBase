Sean Sandys is a third year graduate student at the 
University of Washington.
He graduated in 1994 from
Williams College 
with a double major in 
Computer Science and 
 Astrophysics. Currently, he is 
trying to finish his 
qualifying exams
.  His interests include 
Computational Astronomy,
Software
Safety and 
Parallel Programming Languages. 


He recently participated in a panel at the 
CRA
Conference at Snowbird 
entitled "Retaining
and Mentoring Minority Students from Underrepresented Groups". For those that are 
interested, here is a description of the 
Undergraduate Tutoring and Mentoring Program here at the University of Washington.



Within the department he is 
co-editor of 
Mossy Bits,
and one of the senators for 
GPSS, the
graduate student
senate here at the University of Washington,
although it is common knowledge that he was appointed because of
his ability to bend the wills of men rather than for any literary
or political skills.



When he is not
working 
he can be found
listening to Jimmy Buffett,
waxing philosophical about his glory days on 
WUFO,
or (mis)quoting some of the finest minds 
of our time. It is also rumored that he is interested in 
brewing some cool refreshing 
beers.
