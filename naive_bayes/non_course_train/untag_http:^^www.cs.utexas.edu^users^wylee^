 Educational/Fun Robots Worked On


  RoboCacing is a Robotics Worm
	built specifically for Robofest 5 1994 organized by the 
        Robot Group in Austin, TX.

  RoboKreta-Besar and 
        RoboKreta-Kicik
        are two intelligent autonomous toy cars built using the chassis
	and motors of two fast remote-controlled (RC) toy racing cars.





 Publication  

Some of  my papers on robotics and
qualitative reasoning research are available online.
My doctoral dissertation titled "The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy for
a Physical Mobile Robot is also online"
