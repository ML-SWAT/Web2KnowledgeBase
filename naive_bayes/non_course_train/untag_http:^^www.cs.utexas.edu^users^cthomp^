I am participating in a Candlelight Vigil Across the Internet
to help increase awareness of violence against women.


Research

My current research interests in artificial intelligence are primarily
in the area of machine learning.  Specifically, I am interested
in Natural Language Acquisition.  
Learning to produce a deep semantic
representation from an input sentence would be useful in many tasks.
My Ph.D. proposal is on corpus-based lexical acquisition.
I wrote my Master's Thesis 
on a system which learned rules suitable for use in a diagnostic expert 
system. 
I am also interested in mobile robots, and had an exhibit at
Robofest 5 in 1994.  In the spring semester of 1995, I was the TA for 
"Building Intelligent Agents".
Here's my finger information,
 a picture of me, my vita, 
 and a list of my publications.
Also, see 
the Machine Learning page
