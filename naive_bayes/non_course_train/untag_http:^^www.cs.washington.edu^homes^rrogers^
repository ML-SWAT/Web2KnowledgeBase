Research:


I have developed system software for the Systolic Cellular Array Machine (SCAM), a massively parallel image processing computer. The software includes a compiler, basic image processing and morphology libraries, and a simulator. You can obtain the software and papers about SCAM here.


I currently work on document layout extraction at the Intelligent Systems Lab. I am also helping to produce a document groundtruth database for the optical character recognition community.


 Science Camps:


I am the Director of Computer Facilities at the Northwest Center For Environmental Education. NCEE offers a summer science camp for students of all ages in Washington's beautiful San Juan Islands.
