Welcome to Markus' home page.

 
 About myself 

I moved from Karlsruhe, Germany
to Seattle in fall 94. For those interested in geography, Karlsruhe is
located in the southwest of Germany, in the state of Baden-Wrttemberg. I grew up in another
part of that state, in the district of 
 Biberach  in Upper Swabia (Oberschwaben).

Before coming to the UW I studied Computer Science at the University of Karlsruhe  from which
I obtained a "Diplom" (M.S.) in Computer Science in 1992. 

I also spent one year at UMass  as a  Fulbright grantee.
My main research interests are parallel and distributed computing,
object-oriented systems and compilers. Currently I am working on
  dynamic compilation.

Non-CS interests include  Spanish  and  Latin American Culture, 
travel , e.g. to   
good  books, e.g. 

The Labyrinth of Solitude ,  chess 

non-mainstream movies, eg Die
Angst des Torwarts beim Elfmeter  (do you know 
Handke?) and  salsa or merengue  dancing with  
And, if there's still time left, I check out what else  to do in Seattle. 

More to come..

And a quote: Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow:
they toil not, neither do they 
spin; and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like one of these.  Matthew 6:28
