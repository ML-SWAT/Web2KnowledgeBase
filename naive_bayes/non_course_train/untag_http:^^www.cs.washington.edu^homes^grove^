 Work

I spend most of my time playing with 
Cecil. 
Cecil is a new pure object-oriented langauge that we are using   
as a vehicle for integrated research in the areas of language design, 
programming environments, and optimizing compilers.  

 I also used to be one of the hordes of consultants hanging around
the fringes of the 
SPIN
project. Now that I'm actually attempting to graduate sometime soonish, I
do this much less frequently. 


  Papers I've authored or co-authored.





 Play

 The day just wouldn't be complete without a  Dilbert
fix. Here's a strip that
hits a little too close to home!
  

I am currently managing an  underacheiving 
fantasy football team.  

 I used to spend my summers in New Hampshire, working with  these guys at Wah-Tut-Ca Scout
Reservation (Greater
Lowell Council, BSA).  
Here's a picture of a  Wah-Tut-Ca
sunset, taken right from my cabin.  Just  for kicks,  here's another one.  

 Every once in a while, the boys in my office do  something silly. 
Our 
white water rafting trip was especially cool.  

 After spending a few months in Toronto, I drove back to
Seattle and took a number of detours along the way.  Here are some

hihglights from the trip.
