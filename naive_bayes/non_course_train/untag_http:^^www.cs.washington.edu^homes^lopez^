I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington doing my dissertation
research on the design and implementation of constraint imperative (object-oriented)
languages.

OOPSLA'96 Tutorials
I'm also Tutorials Chair for the upcoming
 OOPSLA'96  conference
in San Jose, California.  The top people in object-oriented technologies and
software development will meet at, speak at, and run the OOPSLA'96 conference.
OOPSLA is well-known for the breadth, depth, and high quality of its
extensive tutorial program.
In previous years, OOPSLA tutorials
have covered all aspects of object-oriented technology from introductory
surveys to industrial software engineering practices and leading-edge academic
research topics.  In response to requests from our past attendees, we
especially encourage proposals on engineering issues and advanced topics.

Anyone considering submitting a proposal for a tutorial should request
guidelines on tutorial submissions from the Tutorials Chair or via the
OOPSLA'96 Electronic Hotline.  Electronic mail submissions of proposals 
are encouraged and will be enthusiastically accepted.  Tutorial proposals
without email addresses will not be accepted.  Tutorial proposals are due
1 MARCH 1996, notification of acceptance will be about 1 MAY 1996, with
camera-ready notes due 9 AUGUST 1996.
