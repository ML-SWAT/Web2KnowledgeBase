Introduction

Welcome to my home page. I am currently constructing this page and
will add more entries and links as time permits. For the time being I
apologize for any incompleteness and resulting inconvenience.


Research
I am a member of Prof.Misra's
PSP Research Group
and of Prof.Emerson's
Temporal Reasoning Group.

As part of my work I have developed a model checker
for finite state UNITY programs and propositional UNITY logic, the 
UNITY Verifier System.


The most recent version of my Ph.D. thesis is
also available.
