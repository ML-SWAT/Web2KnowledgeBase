      I live at The Compound
    
      
      with my wife, Holly Eileen Taylor,
    
      
      my son, Evan James Taylor-Adair,
    
      
      and some other 
      Rice alumni.
    
      Some of my friends who don't live with me include

  
    
      
      
      Joe Carl White, who also does
      Internet consulting,
      
    
      
      
      Matthew Mengerink, who is a fish fanatic and works at
      DejaNews, and
      
    
      
      
      Steve Traylen, who gets me Doctor Who books.
