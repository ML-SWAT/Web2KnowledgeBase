 Clicking on the above picture should provide you a sample of my charming French accent. And  here you'll get a more accurate picture of me.
 Salut, 
I'm a graduate student from  France and I'm trying to survive to the graduate program in Computer Science and to the Northwest. My hometown is Nimes, which is well known for its remains of the Roman Empire (spurs of ancient yet glorious times) and is the driest city in France. I've spent my undergraduate studies in  Paris (Universit Paris VI
and  Institut National des Tlcommunications ), which is a wonderful  city if you are a tourist. 

This quarter I'm TAing  CSE 457, taught by Anna Karlin.


I'm one of the guys in c112, where I can be found much too often.


Hi Dani, here is my quals report.


As for the rest, I like British movies, the  Monty Python, swimming, Nick Cave, Corto Maltese (an Italian comics), cats, Paris, Berlin, Venise, the Simpsons (2.7 M mpeg) .. and the rain when it's a surprise.




I like traditionnal french marine songs and try to collect them. 

Otherwise, I'm working in graphics under Anna Karlin's supervision, although I was formerly studying system
here and got my name on a paper:


Implementing Global Memory Management in a Workstation Cluster.
Michael J. Feeley, William E. Morgan, Frederic H. Pighin, Anna R. Karlin,
Henry M. Levy, and Chandramohan A. Thekkath.  In Proceedings of the 
15th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, December
1995.

 New: Live Action !  
Here is a breath-taking picture of c112 door (refreshed every two minutes). And if you are very lucky you might even have a look at Darren or Juan, .. note that it might be dark here. 

More live action with a picture of UW's Red Square (refreshed every five minutes), .. note that it might rain there.
