I'm currently a graduate student at Univ. of Washington, in
the Department of Computer Science (officially CSE).  My
office is 431 Sieg.  I'm working with the RaPiD Project.
I used to say that I was a first-year student, but during the
summer after my second year, someone expressed concern about
this characterization.
Where am I?  I'm usually somewhere in North Seattle, where I
live and go to school.
Yet another picture and one more (the best of the lot).  One
of these days, I'll get around to scanning in some better ones.
A Norwegian poem I like
A collection of fortunes received by me  friends at local
Chinese restaurants.

I hope some folks might find this stuff useful.

Contacting me
I love to travel (but I don't necessarily tell everyone when I
do)
Hiring me
Where did I come from?
I got my high-school diploma from Live Oak High School in
Morgan Hill, CA, where I was taught Prolog for the first time.
I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from
UC Davis, where I was taught Prolog for the second time.  (And
yes, I was taught Prolog once more at UW.  I'm just glad I
didn't use it during my year at the University of Bergen.)  I
also did research for a professor in the Electrical and
Computer Engineering department.
Fun Stuff

While I was at UC Davis, my partners in various CS-related
activities tended to be Matt, Chris, and James.  (We even
got together recently, using Chris's marriage to Joanne as an
excuse; Chris's brother also made it
in the photo.)


Throughout my undergraduate years, I kept biking more and more,
but never very far (Davis isn't that big, and it's flat).
During my year as an exchange student to the University of
Bergen, I biked hillier and longer routes, so when I returned
to Davis, I took up rollerblading, since biking around town was
now too easy.
My biking dropped off during the year I worked at Hewlett
Packard, but it returned with a vengeance when I moved to
Seattle.  I've done the annual Seattle-to-Portland bike ride in
two days; I may do it in one some year.  But that's only in
season (March/April-June).  The rest of the year, I just
commute by bike and do lots of dancing, particularly Lindy
Hop.
