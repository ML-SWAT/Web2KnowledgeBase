Personal Interests


   Science fiction and fantasy, written and otherwise.  In
       fact, I should probably be honest and identify the above illustration.
       It's Merlin, the son of Corwin (pictured
       here), who is a favorite fictional
       character of mine from Roger
       Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber.  The image was taken from the
       Amber DRPG published by Phage Press, which I would recommend to anyone
       who likes the books.  Also, I recommend the TV series Babylon 5.
       
       
   Creative writing, both fiction and poetry (no, there will be
       absolutely no links here to any of my work!).
       
       
   Athletics.  In no particular order:
       
	  Tennis 
	  Tae 
	      Kwon Do
	  Distance running
       
       
       
   Role-playing.
       

   Random other things, depending on the day.  Cats.




Random Other Things...



   Go to the homepage of my friend and fellow Williams Alumnus
       Sean Sandys. 

   Look! Up on the Web!  It's a woman!  It's
       a dog!  No, it's former CSE grad student
       Wendy
       Belluomini dressed up as Dogbert!
       
       
   A lot of people have asked me if Theory is a worthwhile area
       of research, or whether it's too abstract to be useful.
       
       Here is a better explanation of the goals and future of
       Theory than I've ever given them.
