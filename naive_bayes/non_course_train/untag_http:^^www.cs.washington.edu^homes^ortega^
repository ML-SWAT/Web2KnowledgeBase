Welcome to my home page
After going to school and working in Boston for 7 years, I decided 
to head west (really northwest).  I came to UW in the fall of 1990 and will 
be leaving sometime in 199x according to my advisor Gaetano Borriello. 
Officially I have been working on the 
Chinook project, 
a CAD tool for real-time embedded controller systems.
Unofficially  I have been brewing beer, learning to hack my Mac, 
and trying to teach my German shepherd, Tequila, how to behave himself.
