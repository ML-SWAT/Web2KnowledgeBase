Emma Y. Wu







Chinese girl coming to US 
on August 18, 1995, to study in the 
Department of Computer Science of 
the University of Texas at Austin.








Interested in what I did in China
?  






Immediately after I get my BS Degree in Computer Science from 

Zhongshan University, I became a Marketing Representative in
IBM China Company, South China Branch, 
trying to deliver the solutions for a small planet to my costomers in 
telecommunication and media industry. 





Hey, this is 

Zhongshan University, you would be surprised to find that I have so many
alumni in US if you enter our  
Alumni Club. 










One nice thing for attending graduate school in Austin is that there are lots 
of intern opportunities for engineering students. This semester, I work as a 
part-time programmer at National Instruments
Inc.
